AB  - An unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei 
      province in China emerged in December of 2019. A novel coronavirus was identified
      as the causative agent and was subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health
      Organization (WHO). Considered a relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus
      that affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans.
      Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of
      COVID-19 continues to rise, with 50,580 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1,526
      deaths worldwide. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the current
      state of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.

TI  - 2019-novel Coronavirus severe adult respiratory distress syndrome in two cases in
      Italy: An uncommon radiological presentation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several recent case reports have described common early chest
      imaging findings of lung pathology caused by 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV2)
      which appear to be similar to those seen previously in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
      infected patients. OBJECTIVE: We present some remarkable imaging findings of the 
      first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from
      Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included,
      showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS:
      Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing
      percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and
      multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up,
      apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary
      vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic 
      tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could
      be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration.
      Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with
      short-axis oval nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Although only two patients have been studied,
      these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in
      literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung
      infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor
      radiological sign of lung impairment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection
      pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the
      COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to
      determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in
      Beijing. METHODS: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency
      Medical Sevice to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic,
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic
      classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared
      the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including
      mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the
      features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. FINDINGS: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients 
      were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals
      for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical
      service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were
      common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia
      cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients
      was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of
      Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact
      with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms
      at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%),
      dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days,
      the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As
      of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital
      in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%.
      INTERPRETATION: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19
      infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases
      in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low
      fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early 
      stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early
      isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and
      communities in Beijing. FUNDING: Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about COVID-19 outside Hubei. The aim of this paper
      was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of
      hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang,
      China. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive
      patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in 
      three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th,
      2020. FINDINGS: A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while 
      another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure
      history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms,
      14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had
      lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C reactive protein. On chest computed
      tomography, lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments 
      presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented
      consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy
      form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei 
      exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had 
      negative findings even10 days later. INTERPRETATION: Most patients presented with
      a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral
      ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly
      suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some
      patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for
      COVID-19. FUNDING: We did not receive any fundings.

AB  - Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019, the diagnosis
      and treatment of patients with cancer have been facing great challenges. Although
      oncologists are not fighting on the front line to against the epidemic, during
      this special period, we should not only protect patients, their families and
      medical staff from the infection of novel Coronavirus, but also minimize the
      impact of the epidemic on the diagnosis and the treatment of patients with
      cancer. Combining the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of tumors with our
      clinical experience, in this epidemic period, we discuss the strategies for
      diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of malignant tumors of the digestive system
      in this article.

TI  - Management strategies of neonatal jaundice during the coronavirus disease 2019
      outbreak.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00347-3 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; formally known as 2019-nCoV) 
      has become a most challenging health emergency. Owing to rigorous quarantine and 
      control measures taken in China, routine neonatal health surveillance and
      follow-up have become challenging. Without follow-up surveillance, some rapid and
      progressive newborn diseases, such as bilirubin encephalopathy, may be ignored.
      The characteristics of onset age of kernicterus suggest that monitoring of
      bilirubin level at home provides a useful way to alert hospital visits and to
      prevent the development of extremely hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, we developed 
      an online follow-up program for convenient monitoring of bilirubin level of
      newborns that is based on our practical experiences. The aim is to make our
      management strategies of neonatal jaundice tailored to the infection prevention
      and control during the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - A well 6-month-old infant with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had
      persistently positive nasopharyngeal swabs to day 16 of admission. This case
      highlights the difficulties in establishing the true incidence of COVID-19 as
      asymptomatic individuals can excrete the virus. These patients may play important
      roles in human-to-human transmission in the community.

AB  - 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is one of the beta coronaviruses and was
      identified as the pathogen of the severe "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)" in
      2019. China has formally included the 2019-nCoV in the statutory notification and
      control system for infectious diseases according to the Law of the People's
      Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.
      Currently, the national defending actions on the 2019-nCoV in China is in a
      critical period. Burn Department is also confronted with risk of infection by the
      2019-nCoV. According to the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19
      (6(th) trial edition), the latest relative literature at home and abroad, the
      features of the COVID-19, recommendations for the COVID-19 prevention and control
      issued by the National Health Commission of China, and management experience of
      diagnosis and treatment in the related disciplines, we put forward
      recommendations for the medical practices of burn treatment during the outbreak
      of the COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency treatment, inpatient treatment,
      operation and ward management, etc. We hope these recommendations could benefit
      the professionals of the same occupation as us and related hospital managers,
      improve the treatment of burn during the outbreak of the COVID-19, and avoid or
      reduce the risk of infection of medical staff .

AB  - The treatment of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) 
      faces compelling challenges. In this issue, we'd like to share our first-line
      treatment experience in treating COVID-19. Hemodynamics need be closely monitored
      and different types of shock should be distinguished. Vasoconstrictor drugs
      should be used rationally and alerting of complications is of the same
      importance. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) needs to be assessed, and
      effective prevention should be carried out for high-risk patients. It is
      necessary to consider the possibility of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in
      patients with sudden onset of oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress,
      reduced blood pressure. However, comprehensive analysis of disease state should
      be taken into the interpretation of abnormally elevated D-Dimer. Nutritional
      support is the basis of treatment. It's important to establish individual therapy
      regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically. Under the current
      epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can only be used empirically, indications
      need to be strictly screened, the blood transfusion process should be closely
      monitored and the curative effect should be dynamically evaluated.

AB  - The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19
      epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of
      the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven
      the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has
      implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports 
      and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative 
      case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for
      modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the
      epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully
      elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during
      previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative 
      number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the
      epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of
      Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV
      outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. 
      Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 
      5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized
      logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. 
      Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020,
      largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of
      7409-7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128-1929 additional cases in
      other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total
      cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588-13,499 in
      other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for
      both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three 
      reporting dates (February 7th - 9th). We also observe that each of the models
      predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other
      provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in
      China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has
      slowed in recent days.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed
      tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging
      findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning 
      and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed.
      RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28,
      severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years)
      were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe
      (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also
      significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild
      patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 degrees C), 49 (98%) patients had
      normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of
      lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild
      patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion 
      was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower
      lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was
      primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension
      towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and
      asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass
      opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and
      fibrosis. CONCLUSION: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground
      glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial
      consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if
      improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment 
      of NCP.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of Imported Cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province: A
      Multicenter Descriptive Study.
LID - ciaa199 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported
      coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Jiangsu Province. METHODS: We
      retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory
      characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three
      Grade A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was
      used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80
      patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of
      46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited
      mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic
      acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical
      manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases
      (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed
      liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed
      abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of
      both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient
      died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS:
      Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate
      symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having
      liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of
      Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two
      consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.

TI  - COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: estimating the epidemic
      potential and effectiveness of public health countermeasures.
LID - taaa030 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taaa030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with
      relative homogeneous mixing. On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on
      cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an
      index case on board around 21-25 January. By 4 February, public health measures
      such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill
      passengers were implemented. By 20 February, 619 of 3,700 passengers and crew
      (17%) were tested positive. METHODS: We estimated the basic reproduction number
      from the initial period of the outbreak using (SEIR) models. We calibrated the
      models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We
      additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures,
      and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of
      differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an
      earlier versus later evacuation of the ship. RESULTS: The basic reproduction rate
      was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in
      Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled
      initial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the
      time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have
      been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and
      lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers
      on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their
      incubation time. CONCLUSIONS: The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an
      already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more
      than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all 
      passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more
      passengers and crew from infection.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China.
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2002032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged
      in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the
      clinical characteristics of the affected patients. METHODS: We extracted data
      regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 
      30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29,
      2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit
      (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: The median age of
      the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary
      composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were
      admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4%
      who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with
      wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan,
      including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever
      (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea
      was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile
      range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic
      finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT
      abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and
      in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in
      83.2% of the patients on admission. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 2 months of the
      current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying
      degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have
      abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China 
      and others.).

TI  - Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool for rapid identification and
      characterization of novel coronavirus genomes.

LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa145 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to
      quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation
      sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic
      clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release 
      in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have
      caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we
      present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify
      the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV-2) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can
      accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole
      genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and 
      validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and
      correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of
      the available public data for SARS-CoV-2. The tool also allows tracking of new
      viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate
      the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19
      disease. AVAILABILITY: https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/cov.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pulmonary illness
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, more than 79,000 people have
      contracted the virus worldwide. The virus is rapidly spreading with
      human-to-human transmission despite imposed precautions. Because similar
      pulmonary syndromes have been reported from other strains of the coronavirus
      family, our aim is to review the lessons from imaging studies obtained during
      severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
      (MERS) outbreaks. CONCLUSION. The review of experiences with the MERS and SARS
      outbreaks will help us better understand the role of the radiologist in combating
      the outbreak of COVID-19. The known imaging manifestations of the novel
      coronavirus and the possible unknowns will also be discussed.

AB  - From December 2019, the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, 
      Hubei, and spread rapidly to the nationwide. On January 20, 2020, the National
      Health Committee classified COVID-19 pneumonia as one of B class infectious
      diseases and treated it as class A infectious disease. During the epidemic
      period, the routine diagnosis and treatment of tumor patients was affected with
      varying degrees. In this special period, we performed the superiority of the
      multi-disciplinary team of diagnosis and treatment, achieved accurate diagnosis
      and treatment of patients with hepatobiliary malignant tumors, provided support
      for these patients with limited medical resources, and helped them to survive
      during the epidemic period.On the basis of fully understanding the new
      coronavirus pneumonia, the treatment strategy should be changed timely during the
      epidemic, and more appropriate treatment methods should be adopted to minimize
      the adverse effect of the epidemic on tumor treatment.

AB  - Prevention and control about the situation of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
      are grim at present. In addition to supporting the frontline actively, medical
      workers in general surgery spare no efforts in making good diagnosis and
      treatment of specialized diseases by optimizing treatment process, providing
      medical advice online, mastering indications of delayed operation and emergency
      operation reasonably, etc. Budd-Chiari syndrome is a complex disorder, and
      severity of the disease varies, serious cases can be life threatening. While
      fighting the epidemic, medical workers should also ensure the medical needs of
      patients. However, instead of continuing the traditional treatment, a new
      management system should be developed. Based on the characteristics of
      Budd-Chiari syndrome patients in China and our experience, we divide the patients
      into ordinary and critical cases, and treatment strategies suitable for the
      epidemic period of COVID-19 are put forward for reference and discussion by
      physicians.

      changes of confirmed cases, fitted the epidemic situation by the population
      growth curve at different stages and took statistical description and analysis of
      the epidemic situation in Anhui province. It was found that the cumulative
      incidence of COVID-19 was 156/100 000 by February 18, 2020 and the trend of
      COVID-19 epidemic declined after February 7, changing from J curve to S curve.
      The actual number of new cases began to decrease from February 2 to February 4
      due to the time of case report and actual onset delayed by 3 to 5 days.

AB  - Objective: To explorethe proper protective measures for pancreaticdiseases
      treatment during theoutbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19). Method:
      Clinical data of four cases of patients that suffered COVID-19from February
      2(nd), 2020 to February 9(th), 2020 in pancreatic surgery were reviewed.After the
      first patientscuffednosocomial infection of COVID-19, the general protective
      measures in our department wereupdated.Only one patient was admitted to each room
      alone, with no more than one caregiver.The body temperature of care givers was
      measuredtwice a day.Primary protections were applied to all staff.The floor was
      sterilized using disinfectant with an effective chlorine concentration of 1000
      mg/L.The protective measures for interventional procedures were as follow.Primary
      protection was applied to the operators ofcentral venipuncture catheter,
      percutaneous abdominal/pleural drainage, percutaneous retroperitoneal drainage,
      percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage and other surgical procedures with 
      local anesthesiaand epidural anesthesia.Secondary protection was applied to the
      operators of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical
      procedures with general anesthesia. Results: During Feb 2(nd), 2020 to Feb 9(th),
      2020, four patients in our department were diagnosed with COVID-19, of which one 
      was died of COVID-19, two were cured, and one is still in hospital for
      COVID-19.After the update ofprotective measures in our department, no more
      nosocomial infection of COVID-19occurred.Two central venipuncture catheter, three
      percutaneous abdominal/pleural drainage, one percutaneous retroperitoneal
      drainage, one percuteneous transhepatic cholecyst drainage and one open surgery
      with general anesthesia were performed with no infection of operators.
      Conclusions: The caregivers of patients are potential infection source of
      COVID-19.Enhanced protective measures including the management measures of
      caregivers can decrease the risk of nosocomial infection of COVID-19.

TI  - Imaging and clinical features of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-020-04735-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also 
      called 2019-nCoV) recently break out in Wuhan, China, and was named as COVID-19. 
      With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other
      regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of 
      these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: All
      patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4,
      2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This
      analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age
      range, 18-86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent
      non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical
      characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics,
      pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In
      addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were
      evaluated to assess radiological evolution. FINDINGS: The majority of infected
      patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly
      presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented
      bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%)
      patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19
      pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 
      (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%),
      adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55
      (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon 
      findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21
      patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the 
      second CT after 3-4 days. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based
      on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and
      laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial
      diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass
      opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical
      chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new
      coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
      aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections
      with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health
      Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections-SARS in 2002-2003 and
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-both caused severe respiratory
      syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a
      global spread are caused by beta-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually
      infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is
      common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of
      coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and 
      more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations
      of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In
      this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of 
      SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10,
      2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.

AB  - The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a
      novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
      There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways
      to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine
      design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between
      SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging
      existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the
      experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the
      immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T 
      cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map
      identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these
      identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21
      February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer
      protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a
      population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of 
      epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in
      China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide
      experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Fast point-of-use detection of, for example, early-stage zoonoses, e.g., Q-fever,
      bovine tuberculosis, or the Covid-19 coronavirus, is beneficial for both humans
      and animal husbandry as it can save lives and livestock. The latter prevents
      farmers from going bankrupt after a zoonoses outbreak. This paper describes the
      development of a fabrication process and the proof-of-principle of a disposable
      DNA amplification chip with an integrated heater. Based on the analysis of the
      milling process, metal adhesion studies, and COMSOL MultiPhysics heat transfer
      simulations, the first batch of chips has been fabricated and successful multiple
      displacement amplification reactions are performed inside these chips. This
      research is the first step towards the development of an early-stage zoonoses
      detection device. Tests with real zoonoses and DNA specific amplification
      reactions still need to be done.

AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, 
      and has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories,
      including the United States (1). As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936
      reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland
      China (1). There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been
      reported in the United States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United
      States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from
      high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States.
      This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local
      health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are
      implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United
      States. These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of
      persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment,
      monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19
      transmission. Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission
      of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the
      spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health
      departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the 
      general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better
      characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development 
      and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics,
      and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation
      closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO)
      and other global partners. Interim guidance is available at
      https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html. As more is learned about this novel
      virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance
      for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and
      communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe
      the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.
      METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation
      sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who 
      underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were
      grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan:
      group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans
      done </=1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4
      (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and 
      compared across the four groups. FINDINGS: 81 patients admitted to hospital
      between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort
      included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49.5 years (SD
      11.0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10.5 (SD 6.4) overall, 2.8
      (3.3) in group 1, 11.1 (5.4) in group 2, 13.0 (5.7) in group 3, and 12.1 (5.9) in
      group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] 
      patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass
      opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of
      849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral
      (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]).
      Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass 
      opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of 
      ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3,
      and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became
      more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). INTERPRETATION:
      COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in
      asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse
      bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with
      consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with
      clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19
      pneumonia. FUNDING: None.

LID - 10.12932/AP-200220-0772 [doi]
AB  - As the world is witnessing the epidemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel 
      coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerging genetics and clinical evidences suggest a
      similar path to those of SARS and MERS. The rapid genomic sequencing and open
      access data, together with advanced vaccine technology, are expected to give us
      more knowledge on the pathogen itself, including the host immune response as well
      as the plan for therapeutic vaccines in the near future. This review aims to
      provide a comparative view among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly epidemic
      SARS-CoV-2, in the hope to gain a better understanding of the host-pathogen
      interaction, host immune responses, and the pathogen immune evasion strategies.
      This predictive view may help in designing an immune intervention or preventive
      vaccine for COVID-19 in the near future.

AB  - Since December 2019, unexplained pneumonia has appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei
      Province, and a new type of coronavirus infection was confirmed as COVID-19.
      COVID-19 spread rapidly nationwide and abroad. The COVID-19 has brought huge
      impacts to all the people and walks of life, especially to the medical and health
      systems. It has also brought great challenges to the treatment of patients with
      cancer. Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor in China and most of the
      patients are in the middle and advanced stage when diagnosed, with
      immunosuppressive and poor prognosis. The selection of surgical procedures and
      perioperative managements of esophageal cancer require all thoracic surgeons work
      together to figure out a reasonable system of surgical treatment and emergency
      response.

PG  - 1-21
AB  - Prior to the global outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were
      the only coronaviruses known to infect humans. Following the SARS outbreak, 5
      additional coronaviruses have been discovered in humans, most recently the novel 
      coronavirus COVID-19, believed to have originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
      China. SARS-CoV and MERSCoV are particularly pathogenic in humans and are
      associated with high mortality. In this review, the epidemiology,
      pathophysiology, and management of the recently discovered COVID-19 are reviewed,
      with a focus on best practices and the public health implications.

AB  - The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over 
      China and to more than 20 other countries. Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2)
      nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In
      addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an
      accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected
      patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure
      timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care 
      lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously
      against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect
      patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out
      clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection
      sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples
      collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8
      different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and
      specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results
      obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The
      results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick
      blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better
      utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used
      for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in
      hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is protected by

TI  - The neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2 may be at least partially responsible
      for the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25728 [doi]
AB  - Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic
      coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 
      2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares
      highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal
      pneumonia (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for
      SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of COVID-19 patients is
      respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care
      could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some COVID-19 patients also showed
      neurologic signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows
      that coronavriruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that
      they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.
      The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and 
      experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some
      coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route
      to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechano- and chemoreceptors in
      the lung and lower respiratory airways. In light of the high similarity between
      SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it is quite likely that the potential invasion of
      SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of COVID-19 
      patients. Awareness of this will have important guiding significance for the
      prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure. (229

TI  - Evolutionary history, potential intermediate animal host, and cross-species
      analyses of SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25731 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in
      China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with
      sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed. To
      explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we
      re-analyzed virome datasets from pangolins and representative SARS-related
      coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike
      glycoprotein gene. We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission
      network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on
      Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we
      estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary
      rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22-24 November 2019 and 1.19-1.31 x 10(-3) 
      substitutions per site per year, respectively. Our results also revealed that the
      BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus
      than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and
      SRR10168378). We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human
      SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike 
      protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and
      transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not
      have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus,
      which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly
      from pangolins. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

      Coronavirus-A Possible Reference for Coronavirus Disease-19 Treatment Option.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25729 [doi]
AB  - In the past few decades, coronaviruses have risen as a global threat to public
      health. Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from Wuhan
      caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19.
      However, there are agents that were used during the SARS and MERS epidemics. We
      could learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that
      inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus. In this review, we discuss the
      literature on the efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo, especially in patients
      with SARS and MERS, so that we might clarify the potential for the use of LPV in 
      patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Expert Recommendations for Tracheal Intubation in Critically ill Patients with
      Noval Coronavirus Disease 2019.
LID - 10.24920/003724 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), 
      is a highly contagious disease. It firstly appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of
      China in December 2019. During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout
      China and spread to multiple countries through infected persons travelling by
      air. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue
      and cough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop to the 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and
      coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact
      and natural aerosols from human-to-human. Therefore, high-risk aerosol-producing 
      procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high 
      risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists
      after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported 
      in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society
      of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we
      hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline
      anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management,
      enhanced droplet/airborne PPE should be applied to the health care providers. A
      good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For
      patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided and modified
      rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant
      should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good
      preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Reduced Travel on Exportation Dynamics of Novel
      Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19).
LID - E601 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020601 [doi]
AB  - The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in
      January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel
      coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China. Data on confirmed cases
      diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the
      impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the
      number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the
      time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated 
      that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented,
      corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual
      scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in
      Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days.
      Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the
      delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on
      freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated
      epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.

TI  - Correlation of Chest CT and RT-PCR Testing in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      in China: A Report of 1014 Cases.
PG  - 200642
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2020200642 [doi]
AB  - Background Chest CT is used for diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19), as an important complement to the reverse-transcription polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and
      consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. 
      Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who
      underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference 
      standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed.
      Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of
      RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was
      analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4
      days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR
      results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest
      CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on
      positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) 
      had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely
      cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT
      scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR
      results was 5.1 +/- 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR 
      result was 6.9 +/- 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT
      consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR
      results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before 
      the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity
      for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the
      current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.

AB  - The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly.
      In order to prevent cluster outbreaks, the government strengthened the management
      and control of personnel mobility, which had a great impact on the examination
      and treatment of breast cancer patients. This paper discusses how to realize
      scientific health management of breast cancer patients outside the hospital based
      on the existing epidemic situation, characteristics of breast cancer patients and
      public health safety factors. The breast cancer patients should synthetically
      consider the epidemic prevention situation of inhabitance, the disease stage and 
      previous therapeutic schedule to decide the next therapeutic schedule. If
      necessary, after professional discussion and communication between doctors and
      patients online or offline, the hospital visiting time should be delayed through 
      seeking alternative treatment schemes, and psychological counseling for patients 
      should be paid attention to at the same time.

      predict potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25726 [doi]
AB  - From the beginning of 2002 and 2012, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) crossed
      the species barriers to infect humans caused thousands of infections and hundreds
      of deaths, respectively. Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes the
      outbreaks of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered. Until February
      18, 2020, there are 72533 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 10644 severe cases)
      and 1872 deaths in China. SARS-CoV-2 is surging in the public and caused
      substantial burdens due to its human-to-human transmission. However, the
      intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. Finding the possible
      intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the
      epidemic. In this study, we used systematic comparison and analysis to predict
      the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike
      protein and the host receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). The
      interaction between the key amino acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that 
      like previous suggested pangolins and snacks, the turtles (C. picta bellii, C.
      mydas, and P. sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting 
      SARS-CoV-2 to human. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

      transmission into Africa and South America.
PG  - e41

AB  - Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last
      week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27
      countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was 
      to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air
      flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou)
      to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated
      passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, 
      an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the 
      direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of
      2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination
      countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city
      reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on 
      the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st
      quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were
      destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The 
      risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the 
      WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, 
      of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia
      (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of
      the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 
      1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV
      transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which
      reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy;
      in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of
      them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of
      transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil
      showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the
      countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31
      January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe
      (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and 
      Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition,
      isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening,
      public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of 
      further spread to naive countries.

AB  - From December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia (formerly known
      as the 2019 novel Coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) broke out in Wuhan, China. In this
      study, we present serial CT findings in a 40-year-old female patient with
      COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with the symptoms of fever, chest tightness, and
      fatigue. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. CT showed rapidly progressing
      peripheral consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs. After
      treatment, the lesions were shown to be almost absorbed leaving the fibrous
      lesions.

TI  - Chest Radiographic and CT Findings of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease
      (COVID-19): Analysis of Nine Patients Treated in Korea.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study presents a preliminary report on the chest radiographic and
      computed tomography (CT) findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) pneumonia in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of a
      multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic
      Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone 
      chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of
      COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher's exact test was used to compare CT
      findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. RESULTS: Three of the nine 
      patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and
      most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed 
      bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo
      sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including
      patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions
      (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of
      the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were
      composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass
      opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower
      lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were 
      primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: 
      COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass
      opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral
      posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia
      had normal chest radiographs.

      SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
LID - E244 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v12020244 [doi]
AB  - After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world
      in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause
      severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV
      isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the
      Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes
      acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as "coronavirus
      disease 2019" (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused
      widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are 
      some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features
      between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal
      of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and
      SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and 
      treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.

TI  - Short-term Forecasts of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China:
      February 13-23, 2020.
LID - E596 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020596 [doi]
AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread within and outside of China,
      despite several social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government.
      Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition
      and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic,
      particularly in the epidemic's epicenter. Here we use previously validated
      phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported
      cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China. Using daily reported cumulative case data
      up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report
      5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports. Specifically, we
      generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth
      model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to
      forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases. Forecasts from each of
      the models suggest the outbreaks may be nearing extinction in both Guangdong and 
      Zhejiang; however, the sub-epidemic model predictions also include the potential 
      for further sustained transmission, particularly in Zhejiang. Our 10-day
      forecasts across the three models predict an additional 65-81 cases (upper
      bounds: 169-507) in Guangdong and an additional 44-354 (upper bounds: 141-875)
      cases in Zhejiang by February 23, 2020. In the best-case scenario, current data
      suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.

TI  - Communicating the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
LID - E580 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020580 [doi]
AB  - To understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common
      epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk 
      of death among cases. However, there are three technical obstacles that should be
      addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative
      number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because 
      deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from
      illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of
      reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there
      can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who
      are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those 
      infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows
      and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic,
      health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from
      COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that
      can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly 
      mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death
      among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with
      underlying comorbidities require additional care.

TI  - Estimation of the reproductive number of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and the
      probable outbreak size on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: A data-driven
      analysis.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having
      COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial
      importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the
      early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship.
      METHOD: We fitted the reported serial interval (Mean and standard deviation) with
      a gamma distribution and applied "earlyR" package in R to estimate the R0 in the 
      early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied "projections" package in R to
      simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily
      incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval
      distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that
      daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily
      infectiousness. RESULTS: The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for
      COVID-19 outbreak at early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence
      interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06-2.52) estimated by the bootstrap
      resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would
      gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514
      (1384-1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by
      25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to
      1081 (981-1177) and 758 (697-817), respectively. CONCLUSION: The median with 95% 
      CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06-2.52) during the early stage
      experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and
      probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict
      infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential
      of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.

LID - 10.1111/1751-2980.12851 [doi]
AB  - Since end of December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown
      origin was reported from Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of Feb 17th, 2020,
      statistical data show that the outbreak constitutes an epidemic threat in China, 
      where the exponential increase in patients has reached 75114 confirmed cases,
      with 2239 deaths. Different from SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus)
      infection, the initial presentations or the chief complain of some patients with 
      the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) were gastrointestinal symptoms. So we call 
      upon all the first-line medical staff to be cautious and pay more attention to
      those untypical patients especially from the epidemic area. Besides, as the viral
      nucleic acids could be found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients
      with COVID-19 infection, the possibility of fecal-oral transmission need to be
      took into account. Based on the previously and recently studies, we speculate
      that COVID-19 may have some relationship with the gut microbiota through
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, thus targeting gut microbiota
      might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of virus-related pneumonia.

AB  - Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in
      Wuhan, China. On January 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
      temporarily named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On
      February 11, 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV
      as Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading all over
      the world, especially in China. Based on the published evidence, we
      systematically discuss the characteristics of COVID-19 in the hope of providing a
      reference for future studies and help for the prevention and control of the

AB  - Currently, the epidemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still ongoing. 
      The characteristics including high contagiousness, herd susceptibility and
      clinical phenotype diversity, made a serious influence on people's daily life and
      rountine therapy for other diseases. Breast dieases are clinical common diseases.
      In the central epidemic area of COVID-19, Hubei province, especially Wuhan, the
      clinical specialists of breast diseases should consider all of the following
      factors comprehensively: the prevention of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment 
      of breast diseases and the accessibility of medical resources. Besides, we should
      select the appropriate therapy and optimize treatment process so as to prevent
      the propagation and cross infection of COVID-19 as well as manage the breast
      diseases without delay. Therefore, we carried out some management proposals of
      the patients with breast diseases in the central epidemic area during the
      epidemic of COVID-19 on the basis of conventional treatment guidelines and
      clinical experiences. The suggestions and corrections from colleagues will be
      welcomed.

AB  - The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still
      remained severe. As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious
      Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine
      is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the
      present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National
      Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and
      established an effective treatment strategy centered on "Four-Anti and
      Two-Balance" for clinical practice. The "Four-Anti and Two-Balance"strategy
      included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and
      maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological
      balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was
      recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical
      detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was
      emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest
      positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10%
      patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR
      results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces,
      indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was
      necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial
      liver blood purification system. The "Four-Anti and
      Two-Balance"strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early 
      antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness
      progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed
      antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine
      storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove
      inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe
      balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy 
      in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of
      moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 
      mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen
      therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients
      with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster
      ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis 
      should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with 
      long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT),
      meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with
      COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as
      Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function
      should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of
      prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal
      microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial
      translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore,
      we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also
      integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation
      through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized
      nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained 
      unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, 
      two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular
      following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have
      been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19
      was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of
      prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dynamic changes of chest CT images of patients with
      corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19). METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were
      admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of
      Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with
      an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The
      shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The
      shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of
      the lesions on the CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: The obvious shadows
      infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases
      there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination.
      Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%)
      had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air
      bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened
      leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During
      hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare, the
      fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging
      manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days
      after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in
      40 cases (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have
      certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring
      disease progress and clinical treatment.

AB  - In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in
      the Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel
      coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease.
      Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by
      World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world.
      As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with
      2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 
      2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition
      of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top
      four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major
      comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary
      heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the
      virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific
      therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1
      public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is
      also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment,
      which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.

TI  - Risk Assessment of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Outbreaks Outside China.
LID - E571 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020571 [doi]
AB  - We developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus
      outbreaks outside of China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major
      outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the
      evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed 
      areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including
      baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy 
      of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in 
      the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We
      found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R
      loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a
      further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel
      restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most
      from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider
      a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected
      groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their
      risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the
      number of cases in China is growing.

TI  - Rigidity of the Outer Shell Predicted by a Protein Intrinsic Disorder Model Sheds
      Light on the COVID-19 (Wuhan-2019-nCoV) Infectivity.
LID - E331 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom10020331 [doi]
AB  - The world is currently witnessing an outbreak of a new coronavirus spreading
      quickly across China and affecting at least 24 other countries. With almost
      65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February
      2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population,
      COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global
      health emergency. The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as 
      Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494
      laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002-2003
      epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases.
      Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral
      infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their
      transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of
      coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their
      shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic 
      disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.

AB  - Rapidly sharing scientific information is an effective way to reduce public panic
      about COVID-19, and doing so is the key to providing real-time guidance to
      epidemiologists working to contain the outbreak, clinicians managing patients,
      and modelers helping to understand future developments and the possible
      effectiveness of various interventions. This issue has rapidly reviewed and
      published articles describing COVID-19, including the drug treatment options for 
      SARS-CoV-2, its clinical characteristics, and therapies involving a combination
      of Chinese and Western medicine, the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the
      treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia according to clinical studies, and
      reflections on the system of reserve medical supplies for public health
      emergencies. As an academic journal, we will continue to quickly and
      transparently share data with frontline healthcare workers who need to know the
      epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19.

LID - S1286-4579(20)30034-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.006 [doi]
AB  - One of the most perplexing questions regarding the current COVID-19 coronavirus
      epidemic is the discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei
      province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world. One possible answer
      is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to
      other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained
      inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been
      documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to
      similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a 
      possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and
      deaths.

AB  - COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus called
      SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a
      global public health emergency. We performed genetic analyses of eighty-six
      complete or near-complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and revealed many mutations and
      deletions on coding and non-coding regions. These observations provided evidence 
      of the genetic diversity and rapid evolution of this novel coronavirus.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China. Since
      then, this highly contagious COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, with a rapid 
      rise in the number of deaths. Novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is
      characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. A variety of chest
      imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of
      COVID-19 syndromes. The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the
      known epidemiology and the imaging findings of COVID-19 syndromes, with a focus
      on the reported imaging findings of NCIP. Moreover, the authors review
      precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage
      patients with known or suspected NCIP. Implementation of a robust plan in the
      radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to 
      patients and department staff members.

TI  - Chest CT Findings in Patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 and its Relationship
      with Clinical Features.
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000670 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in
      patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate its 
      relationship with clinical features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample
      consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The
      chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed and the relationship between them
      was analyzed. RESULTS: Totally 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included.
      With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58/80 (73%) of patients had cough,
      61/80 (76%) of patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT
      abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (GGO) (73/80 cases, 91%),
      consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%) and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%).
      Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12+/-6 lung segments
      involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the
      right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower
      lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80,
      80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%) and the posterior
      basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary
      inflammation index (PII) value was (34%+/-20%) for all the patients. Correlation 
      analysis showed that the PII value was significantly correlated with the values
      of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from
      illness onset and body temperature (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The common chest CT
      findings of COVID-19 are multiple GGO, consolidation and interlobular septal
      thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There
      are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the
      main clinical symptoms and laboratory results. CT plays an important role in the 
      diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health emergency.

      COVID-19.

LID - e55570 [pii]
AB  - Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following
      its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the
      global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand
      factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of
      emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of
      different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history
      and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate
      that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the
      factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases
      missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet
      developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the
      need for measures to limit transmission by travellers who become ill after being 
      missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy
      to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future
      emerging pathogens.

TI  - Facing the COVID-19 outbreak: What should we know and what could we do?
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25720 [doi]
AB  - A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019 and
      caused a serious type of pneumonia called coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19.
      This epidemic quickly spread across China and extended to more than 20 other
      countries. This commentary discusses the reasons for the fast spread of
      SARS-CoV-2 in three aspects: the infectious sources, including the biological
      nature of the virus; the susceptible population; and the transmission routes. The
      current situations and suggestions regarding the control of the disease are
      summarized. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

LID - 10.1007/s00259-020-04734-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this case series is to illustrate the (18)F-FDG PET/CT
      findings of patients with acute respiratory disease caused by COVID-19 in Wuhan, 
      Hubei province of China. METHODS: We describe the (18)F-FDG PET/CT results from
      four patients who were admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and
      fever between January 13 and January 20, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was
      still unrecognized and the virus infectivity was unknown. A retrospective review 
      of the patients' medical history, clinical and laboratory data, as well as
      imaging findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: All
      patients had peripheral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in more
      than two pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions were characterized by a high (18)F-FDG
      uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated
      disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although (18)F-FDG PET/CT cannot be routinely used in an emergency
      setting and is generally not recommended for infectious diseases, our pilot data 
      shed light on the potential clinical utility of this imaging technique in the
      differential diagnosis of complex cases.

AB  - The world is faced with a remarkable coronavirus outbreak with epicentre in
      Wuhan, China. Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020. Rigorous surveillance in other 
      countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but
      resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial. Most
      initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also
      various exotic live animals. Based on the limited initial human-to-human
      transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men,
      coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and
      relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first
      instance is probable. To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to
      human cases are needed with animal or food exposures. According to current
      information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood market might explain 
      the initiation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Seafood tanks, air contamination by
      live animals or rodents are possibilities, but sold animals normally come from
      various sources. The mode of transmission may become clearer in future: usually
      in outbreak investigations, hindsight is easy, but for now information about the 
      initial source of this outbreak is limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread
      from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in
      12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one
      case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a
      country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of
      African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used
      data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected
      provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per
      country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with
      two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations
      Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious
      Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese
      regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest
      importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high
      capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria,
      Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and
      high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same
      exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the
      city of Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are
      stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations.
      Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently
      prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect 
      imported cases and to limit onward transmission. FUNDING: EU Framework Programme

TI  - The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest
      global health threats: what lessons have we learned?
LID - dyaa033 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyaa033 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and
      identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a
      critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their
      spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus
      outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus
      (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed
      literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms,
      treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk
      factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS:
      Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited
      reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of
      COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.
      Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to
      increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large
      hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major 
      international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the 
      outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub
      located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and
      eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two
      prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges 
      the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the
      uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the
      spread of infection.

AB  - In December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread across
      China and beyond. On February 12, 2020, WHO officially named the disease caused
      by the novel coronavirus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since most
      COVID-19 infected patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and characteristic CT
      imaging patterns, radiological examinations have become vital in early diagnosis 
      and assessment of disease course. To date, CT findings have been recommended as
      major evidence for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. This review
      focuses on the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19, while
      highlighting the role of chest CT in prevention and disease control. A full
      translation of this article in Chinese is available.

AB  - The next decade is likely to produce any number of global challenges that will
      affect health and health care, including pan-national infections such as the new 
      coronavirus COVID-19 and others that will be related to global warming. Nurses
      will be required to react to these events, even though they will also be affected
      as ordinary citizens. The future resilience of healthcare services will depend on
      having sufficient numbers of nurses who are adequately resourced to face the
      coming challenges.

AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;
      previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease
      (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is 
      a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health
      Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been
      identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China.
      On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health
      emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two
      bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 
      and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or 
      direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period
      of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with
      pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), 
      fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement 
      with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography
      images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is
      responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China.
      Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the
      primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep
      monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus
      and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

AB  - As of February 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      outbreak started in China in December 2019 has been spreading in many countries
      in the world. With the numbers of confirmed cases are increasing, information on 
      the epidemiologic investigation and clinical manifestation have been accumulated.
      However, data on viral load kinetics in confirmed cases are lacking. Here, we
      present the viral load kinetics of the first two confirmed patients with mild to 
      moderate illnesses in Korea in whom distinct viral load kinetics are shown. This 
      report suggests that viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 may be different from that
      of previously reported other coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV.

TI  - Incubation Period and Other Epidemiological Characteristics of 2019 Novel
      Coronavirus Infections with Right Truncation: A Statistical Analysis of Publicly 
      Available Case Data.
LID - E538 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020538 [doi]
AB  - The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the
      epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural
      history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data
      from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period
      and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19
      infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of
      2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated
      using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to
      hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days
      without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th
      percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of
      quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from
      illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when 
      estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.

      the time between symptom onset and the initial CT scan (i.e. early, 0-2 days (36 
      patients), intermediate 3-5 days (33 patients), late 6-12 days (25 patients)).
      The hallmarks of COVID-19 infection on imaging were bilateral and peripheral
      ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities. Notably, 20/36 (56%) of early
      patients had a normal CT. With a longer time after the onset of symptoms, CT
      findings were more frequent, including consolidation, bilateral and peripheral
      disease, greater total lung involvement, linear opacities, "crazy-paving" pattern
      and the "reverse halo" sign. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 10/36
      early patients (28%), 25/33 intermediate patients (76%), and 22/25 late patients 
      (88%).

AB  - Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be
      transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1,700 bedside clinicians have
      been infected. A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are
      deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation,
      manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal
      cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due
      to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus. As such, we
      developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based
      on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with
      the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the 
      COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1) Standard
      prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during
      HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the
      ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated
      humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port 
      and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter
      between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing
      patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients
      receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port 
      to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation,
      cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction
      catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated
      wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9. For
      patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between
      ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous
      breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients
      are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or
      tracheostomy mask. (11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For
      patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with
      spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh
      nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is
      recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during
      nebulization.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of cases of novel coronavirus 
      pneumonia and a preliminary study to explore the relationship between different
      clinical classification and liver damage. Methods: Consecutively confirmed novel 
      coronavirus infection cases admitted to seven designated hospitals during January
      23, 2020 to February 8, 2020 were included. Clinical classification (mild,
      moderate, severe, and critical) was carried out according to the diagnosis and
      treatment program of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition) issued by 
      the National Health Commission. The research data were analyzed using SPSS19.0
      statistical software. Quantitative data were expressed as median (interquartile
      range), and qualitative data were expressed as frequency and rate. Results: 32
      confirmed cases that met the inclusion criteria were included. 28 cases were of
      mild or moderate type (87.50%), and four cases (12.50%) of severe or critical
      type. Four cases (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial
      asthma, coronary heart disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one
      case (3.13%) was simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant
      tumor. The results of laboratory examination showed that the alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), and
      total bilirubin (TBil) for entire cohort were 26.98 (16.88 ~ 46.09) U/L and 24.75
      (18.71 ~ 31.79) U/L, 39.00 (36.20 ~ 44.20) g/L and 16.40 (11.34- ~ 21.15) mmol/L,
      respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the mild or moderate subgroups were 22.75
      (16.31- ~ 37.25) U/L, 23.63 (18.71 ~ 26.50) U/L, 39.70 (36.50 ~ 46.10) g/L, and
      15.95 (11.34 ~ 20.83) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the severe 
      or critical subgroups were 60.25 (40.88 ~ 68.90) U/L, 37.00 (20.88 ~ 64.45) U/L, 
      35.75 (28.68 ~ 42.00) g/L, and 20.50 (11.28 ~ 25.00) mmol/L, respectively.
      Conclusion: The results of this multicenter retrospective study suggests that
      novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver damage is more likely to be
      caused by adverse drug reactions and systemic inflammation in severe patients
      receiving medical treatment. Therefore, liver function monitoring and evaluation 
      should be strengthened during the treatment of such patients.

AB  - Since late December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases
      (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. With the spread of
      COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients
      has been disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients
      caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more
      susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with
      cancer had poorer prognosis from infection. Lung cancer patients should be the
      priority group for COVID-19 prevention. The protection provisions and control
      measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been
      increasingly concerned. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be
      carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer
      patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of
      COVID-19. Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and individualized
      clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively protect the patients 
      from COVID-19.

AB  - In December 2019, China diagnosed the first patient with 2019 novel coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19), and the following development of the epidemic had a huge
      impact on China and the whole world. For patients with lung occupying lesions,
      the whole process of diagnosis and treatment can not be carried out as usual due 
      to the epidemic. For thoracic surgeons, the timing of surgical intervention
      should be very carefully considered. All thoracic surgeons in China should work
      together to develop the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this
      special situation, and continuously update the recommendations based on epidemic 
      changes and further understanding of COVID-19. Here, we only offer some
      preliminary suggestions based on our own knowledge for further reference and
      discussion.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of 140 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan,
      China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread.
      We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients 
      infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Electronic medical records including
      demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and
      radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed
      result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: An
      approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found,
      with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired
      cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal
      symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas
      hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common
      comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were
      self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not
      reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD,
      1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or
      patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding.
      Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood
      eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r =
      .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients after hospital
      admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and
      procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients
      (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized
      COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential 
      indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors
      for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more
      prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak in
      Wuhan, and has quickly spread to all provinces in China and 26 other countries
      around the world, leading to a serious situation for epidemic prevention. So far,
      there is still no specific medicine. Previous studies have shown that chloroquine
      phosphate (chloroquine) had a wide range of antiviral effects, including
      anti-coronavirus. Here we found that treating the patients diagnosed as novel
      coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success rate of
      treatment, shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome. In order to guide
      and regulate the use of chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia,
      the multicenter collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of
      Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in
      the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus
      after extensive discussion. It recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, 500mg
      twice per day for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe
      cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and without contraindications to
      chloroquine.

TI  - Real-Time Estimation of the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
      Infection: Inference Using Exported Cases.
LID - E523 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020523 [doi]
AB  - The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that were
      confirmed outside China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative
      incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of
      the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic
      potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential
      growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR 
      and the basic reproduction number-the average number of secondary cases generated
      by a single primary case in a naive population. We modeled epidemic growth either
      from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or 
      using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based
      on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January 2020. The cumulative
      incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% confidence
      interval [CI]: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158),
      respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%,
      7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic
      reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI:
      2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued 
      that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a
      pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using 
      publicly available data.

AB  - Pneumonia caused by SARS-Cov-2 infection has been reported in Wuhan since
      December 2019, and spread rapidly across the country. The radical operation of
      colorectal cancer is confine operation. Patients with colorectal cancer should
      receive operation as soon as possible after elective operation is resumed in each
      hospital. SARS-Cov-2 virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic infectors, and it
      has been confirmed to be transmitted by droplets and contact. However, fecal-oral
      transmission and aerosol transmission have not been excluded. Based
      onLaparoscopic colorectal operation experiences, the author suggests that the
      surgery strategy for colorectal cancer patients under the COVID-19 situation.
      Recommending laparoscopy-assisted radical surgery for colorectal cancer patients.
      The aerosols need to be strictly managed during operation. NOSES and TaTME should
      be carried out with cautious during the epidemic period. Protective stoma should 
      be carried out scientifically and reasonably, and the protection of operating
      room personnel should be strengthened.

AB  - There is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV),
      which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 17 other countries.
      Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a
      global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing
      of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control
      activities. This information should include reports from outbreak sites and from 
      laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates
      the virology, epidemiology, clinical management strategies from both English and 
      Chinese literature, official news channels, and other official government
      documents. In addition, by fitting the number of infections with a single-term
      exponential model, we report that the infection is spreading at an exponential
      rate, with a doubling period of 1.8 days.

AB  - KEY POINTS: * Novel coronavirus (COVID-19)-infected pneumonia usually manifests
      as bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lung periphery on chest CT scans. *
      Role of radiologists includes not only early detection of lung abnormality, but
      also suggestion of disease severity, potential progression to acute respiratory
      distress syndrome, and possible bacterial co-infection in hospitalized patients.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2)
      causing a cluster of respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) 
      in Wuhan, China, was identified on 7 January 2020. The epidemic quickly
      disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been
      confirmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was 
      implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases
      early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and
      follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were
      confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was
      immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure
      and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been
      discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no 
      secondary transmission has been identified. Effective collaboration between all
      parties involved in the surveillance and response to emerging threats is required
      to detect imported cases early and to implement adequate control measures.

TI  - Can Chinese Medicine Be Used for Prevention of Corona Virus Disease 2019
      (COVID-19)? A Review of Historical Classics, Research Evidence and Current
      Prevention Programs.
LID - 10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China.
      This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for
      the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed 
      ancient classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and
      treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention
      programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were
      retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research 
      evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies
      using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use
      of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient
      Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where
      preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of
      SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM
      contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM 
      group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95%
      confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in 
      China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to
      protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve
      dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi),
      Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma
      Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and
      Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human 
      evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be
      an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population.
      Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential
      preventive effect of CM.

AB  - The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19
      and 1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 
      in Gansu Province were analyzed. The first patient A developed on January 22,
      2020, with a history of residence in Wuhan, and confirmed severe cases of NCP on 
      January 24, 2020; patient B, on January 23, 2020, diagnosed on January 31, severe
      cases; patient C, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient D, asymptomatic,
      diagnosed on January 27; patient E, on January 24, diagnosed on January 28;
      patient F, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 31; Patient G was asymptomatic and 
      was diagnosed on January 31. In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was
      negative and asymptomatic, and he was discharged early. Among the 7 patients, 1
      case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively
      controlled after active treatment. Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were 
      positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative. In this
      clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies
      were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to
      control the epidemic. Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose
      pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung
      lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.

AB  - Objective: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan,
      China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive,
      exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All
      COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's
      Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient
      characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3)
      calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of
      viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis.
      Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186
      (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and
      889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed 
      cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and
      considered mild (80.9%). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases
      for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei
      sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1 386 counties across all 
      31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked in
      January 23-26, then began to decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 
      health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%). Conclusions: The
      COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It only took 30 days to expand from
      Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long
      holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.

TI  - Challenges to the system of reserve medical supplies for public health
      emergencies: reflections on the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in China.
LID - 10.5582/bst.2020.01043 [doi]
AB  - On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), China is now at 
      a critical period in the control of the epidemic. The Chinese Government has been
      taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control
      measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a
      serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage 
      of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing.
      This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention
      and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to
      quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and 
      it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the
      emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and
      there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency
      medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the 
      management of public health emergencies. Based on international experiences with 
      pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency
      reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public
      health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of
      international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies
      of international concern in the future.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2,
      leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. At present,
      there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an
      important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and 
      ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system
      inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe
      pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively
      relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding
      of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang
      (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was
      broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia.
      Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients
      with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and
      might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.

AB  - Through literature review and group discussion, Special Expert Group for Control 
      of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine
      Association formulated an update on the epidemiological characteristics of novel 
      coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). The initial source of the 2019 novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with
      pangolins as a potential animal host. Currently the main source of infection is
      NCP patients, and asymptomatic carriers may also be infectious. The virus is
      believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact. People are all generally
      susceptible to the virus. The average incubation period was 5.2 days, and the
      basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak. Most NCP
      patients were clinically mild cases. The case fatality rate was 2.38%, and
      elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death. Strategies
      for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic surveillance,
      quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of suspected
      cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening prevention and
      control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing possible rebound 
      of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese Spring Festival
      holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control.

AB  - The New Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP, also named as COVID-19 by WHO on Feb 11 2020,
      is now causing a severe public health emergency in China since. The number of
      diagnosed cases is more than 40,000 until the submission of this manuscript.
      Coronavirus has caused several epidemic situations world widely, but the present 
      contagious disease caused by 2019 new Coronavirus is unprecedentedly fulminating.
      The published cohorts of 2019 new Coronavirus (n-Cov) are single-center studies, 
      or retrospective studies. We here share the therapeutic experiences of NCP
      treatment with literature review. Combination of Ribavirin and Interferon-alpha
      is recommended by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised
      Edition) because of the effect on MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and
      the effectiveness of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Remdisivir needs to be confirmed by 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), given the situation of no specific antivirus
      drug on NCP is unavailable. Systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended as a
      short term use (1~2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), 3~5d ) by the 5(th) edition National Health 
      Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) yet RCTs are expected to confirm the
      effectiveness. Inappropriate application of antibiotics should be avoided,
      especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics, for the NCP is not
      often complicated with bacterial infection.

AB  - Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has
      been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea 
      are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have
      occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns
      about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed
      with COVID-19 infection in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had 
      mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of
      hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on 
      day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and
      three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of 
      the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China.
      Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered,
      beta-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus
      titers were observed.

TI  - Time Course of Lung Changes On Chest CT During Recovery From 2019 Novel
      Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia.

AB  - Background Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in
      COVID-19 pneumonia. Purpose To determine the change in chest CT findings
      associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery.
      Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with RT-PCR
      confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February
      2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any
      time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat Chest CT was obtained at
      approximately 4 day intervals. The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement
      (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.
      Results Twenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with
      confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. These patients under went a total of
      82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 4+/-1 days (range: 1-8 days). All
      patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 17+/-4 days (range: 
      11-26 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the
      calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25),
      p<0.001). Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4
      stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) 
      in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 2+/-2; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days):
      increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT
      score (6+/-4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%)
      patients with the peak of total CT score (7+/-4); (4) Stage-4 (>/=14 days):
      gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total
      CT score (6+/-4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion In patients recovering 
      from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease
      course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10
      days after initial onset of symptoms.

AB  - Just a few weeks before the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) 
      was reported in the United States, the US Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC) issued a bold promise to the nation: the agency will use its
      scientific expertise to bring a new level of preparedness in the United States
      and global health security against current and growing threats, finally eliminate
      certain diseases, and bring an end to the devastation of epidemics.(1) The
      current outbreak of COVID-19 reminds us how urgent this promise is and just how
      critical it is to continue to sustain and strengthen our nation's public health
      infrastructure. The unprecedented pace of the public health response to COVID-19 
      has only been possible because of prior investments in public health
      preparedness. To accelerate our pace and meet the challenges of current and
      future health threats, we must advance our world-class data and analytics
      capabilities; maintain and expand our state-of-the-art public health laboratory
      capacity; continue building a workforce of trusted, expert, public health
      professionals; sustain our capacity to rapidly respond to outbreaks at their
      source; and assure a strong global and domestic preparedness capacity. (Am J

TI  - Potential Interventions for Novel Coronavirus in China: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25707 [doi]
AB  - An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed
      significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of
      treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to 
      control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all
      treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA virus
      infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific
      treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We
      suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated 
      before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA
      virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected
      people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given 
      to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the
      potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the
      infection is uncontrollable. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Practical recommendations for critical care and anesthesiology teams caring for
      novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patients.
LID - 10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x [doi]
AB  - A global health emergency has been declared by the World Health Organization as
      the 2019-nCoV outbreak spreads across the world, with confirmed patients in
      Canada. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory
      failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal
      treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is 
      necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare 
      workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are
      currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of
      airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in
      specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding 
      patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment,
      resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations 
      planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local
      outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is
      evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness
      regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which initially began in China, has
      spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases
      increasing every day. With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak
      back in 2002 and 2003 in China, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of
      international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. Herein, we
      present on an overview of the currently available information on the
      pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of
      this virus.
