TI  - The Sacubitril/Valsartan, a First-in-Class, Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin
      Inhibitor (ARNI): Potential Uses in Hypertension, Heart Failure, and Beyond.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1007/s11886-018-0944-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) is a first-in-class,
      novel-acting, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) that provides
      inhibition of neprilysin and the angiotensin (AT1) receptor. A recent clinical
      trial PRARDIGM-HF demonstrated that this drug is superior to
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for improving the prognosis in the
      patients with heart failure, and this has resulted in the drug being included in 
      clinical practice guidelines for the management of heart failure with reduced
      ejection fraction (EF). In addition, sacubitril/valsartan has been developed for 
      the management of hypertension, because it has unique anti-aging properties.
      However, the clinical evidence of mechanism has not been well validated. RECENT
      FINDINGS: A recent mechanistic study PARAMETER demonstrated that
      sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) is superior to angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)
      monotherapy for reducing central aortic systolic pressure (primary endpoint) as
      well as for central aortic pulse pressure (secondary endpoint) and nocturnal BP
      preferentially. Considering these results, sacubitril/valsartan may be an
      attractive therapeutic agent to treat the elderly with age-related hypertension
      phenotypes, such as drug-uncontrolled (resistant) hypertension characterized as
      systolic (central) hypertension (structural hypertension) and/or nocturnal
      hypertension (salt-sensitive hypertension). These are the high-risk hypertension 
      phenotypes which are prone to develop heart failure with preserved EF and chronic
      kidney disease. Sacubitril/valsartan may be effective to suppress the age-related
      continuum from hypertension to heart failure, and it could be clinically useful
      not only for secondary prevention, but also as primary prevention of heart
      failure in uncontrolled elderly hypertensive patients.

TI  - Pattern of inpatient pediatric cardiology consultations in sub-Saharan Africa.
LID - 10.1111/chd.12573 [doi]
AB  - Malawi is one of the poorest nations in the world, ranked 151st among 195
      countries by the World Bank, with an under-5-year mortality rate of 63 per 1000
      live births. There are no previous studies describing the spectrum of inpatient
      pediatric cardiology consultations in sub-Saharan Africa. A descriptive cohort
      study was performed at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), a tertiary care hospital in
      Lilongwe, Malawi. Demographic, anthropometric, and clinical information for all
      cardiology consults patients aged 0-18 years admitted to the children's wards
      over a period of 1 month was reviewed. Seventy-three consults and 69
      echocardiograms were performed on 71 patients (35 males, 38 females). The median 
      (IQR) age was 3.1 years (9 months-10.5 years). About 53% (39/73) had failure to
      thrive, 4.1% (3/73) were sero-reactive for HIV and 100% (73/73) were fully
      immunized for age per the Expanded Program on Immunization schedule. Seventy-four
      percent of the echocardiograms were abnormal, with 34.8% (24/69) having
      congenital heart disease (CHD) and 18.8% (13/69) having acquired heart disease
      (AHD) with preserved cardiac function. Among CHD, 10.1% (7/69) had cyanotic CHD
      and 24.6% (17/769 had acyanotic CHD. Among AHD, 10.1% (7/69) had rheumatic heart 
      disease with preserved cardiac function. Symptomatic systolic heart failure (HF) 
      with ejection fraction <50%, was found in 20.3% (14/69), and pulmonary
      hypertension was diagnosed in 10.1% (7/69). Overall admission mortality was 5.5% 
      (4/73). Three patients left the hospital against medical advice. None of the
      patients with systolic HF had CHD. There was no significant association of HIV,
      gender, or failure to thrive on presence of systolic HF. This is the first report
      describing the spectrum of pediatric cardiology consults in an inpatient setting 
      in Malawi. There was an unexpectedly high proportion of CHD and systolic HF.
      Further studies should be conducted to explore the implications and potential
      causes of these findings.

TI  - New Therapeutic Approaches for the Treatment of Hyperkalemia in Patients Treated 
      with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors.
LID - 10.1007/s10557-017-6767-5 [doi]
AB  - Hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L) is a common clinical problem in
      patients with chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure. 
      It can result from increased K(+) intake, impaired distribution between
      intracellular and extracellular spaces, and most frequently, decreased renal
      excretion. Patients at the highest risk of hyperkalemia are treated with
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASIs) as they improve
      cardiovascular and renal outcomes and are strongly recommended in clinical
      guidelines. However, RAASIs cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia, a key
      limitation to fully titrate RAASIs in patients who are most likely to benefit
      from treatment. Until recently, drugs for the treatment of hyperkalemia presented
      limited efficacy and/or safety concerns and there was an unmet need of new drugs 
      to control hyperkalemia while maintaining RAASI therapy. We provide an overview
      of the mechanisms involved in K(+) homeostasis and the epidemiology and
      management of hyperkalemia as a complication in cardiovascular patients and,
      finally, analyze the efficacy and safety of two new polymer-based, non-systemic
      agents, patiromer calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS-9), designed to 
      increase fecal K(+) loss and to normalize elevated serum K(+) levels and
      chronically maintain K(+) homeostasis in hyperkalemic patients treated with
      RAASIs.

TI  - Persian Registry Of cardioVascular diseasE (PROVE): Design and methodology.
PG  - 236-244
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to create and establish a database called "Persian
      Registry Of cardioVascular diseasE (PROVE)" in order to be used for future
      research and in addition, as a tool to develop national guidelines for diagnosis,
      treatment, and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this paper, the
      design and methodology of the PROVE pilot study will be discussed, launched in
      Isfahan, Iran, in 2015-2016. METHODS: Through establishing PROVE, patients' data 
      were collected from hospitals and outpatient clinics prospectively or
      retrospectively and followed up for a maximum of three years based on the type of
      CVDs. The inclusion criteria were as patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS),
      ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF),
      heart failure (HF), congenital heart disease (CHD), percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI), and chronic ischemic cardiovascular disease (CICD). Specific 
      protocols, questionnaires, and glossaries were developed for each registry. In
      order to ensure the validation of the protocols, questionnaires, data collection,
      management, and analysis, a well-established quality control (QC) protocol was
      developed and implemented. Data confidentiality was considered. RESULTS: In order
      to register patients with ACS, STEMI, stroke, HF, PCI, and CICD, the hospital
      recorded data were used, whereas, in case of AF and CHD registries, the data were
      collected from hospitals and outpatient clinics. During the pilot phase of the
      study in Isfahan, from March 2015 to September 2016, 9427 patients were
      registered as ACS including 809 as STEMI, 1195 patients with HF, 363 with AF, 761
      with stroke, 1136 with CHD, 1200 with PCI, and 9 with CICD. Data collection and
      management were performed under the supervision of the QC group. CONCLUSION:
      PROVE was developed and implemented in Isfahan as a pilot study, in order to be
      implemented at national level in future. It provides a valuable source of valid
      data that could be used for future research, re-evaluation of current CVD
      management and more specifically, gap analysis and as a tool for assessment of
      the type of CVDs, prevention, treatment, and control by health care decision
      makers.

TI  - Givinostat reduces adverse cardiac remodeling through regulating fibroblasts
      activation.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1038/s41419-017-0174-5 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major burden on the healthcare system:
      indeed, over two million new cases are diagnosed every year worldwide.
      Unfortunately, important drawbacks for the treatment of these patients derive
      from our current inability to stop the structural alterations that lead to heart 
      failure, the common endpoint of many CVDs. In this scenario, a better
      understanding of the role of epigenetics - hereditable changes of chromatin that 
      do not alter the DNA sequence itself - is warranted. To date, hyperacetylation of
      histones has been reported in hypertension and myocardial infarction, but the use
      of inhibitors for treating CVDs remains limited. Here, we studied the effect of
      the histone deacetylase inhibitor Givinostat on a mouse model of acute myocardial
      infarction. We found that it contributes to decrease endothelial-to-mesenchymal
      transition and inflammation, reducing cardiac fibrosis and improving heart
      performance and protecting the blood vessels from apoptosis through the
      modulatory effect of cardiac fibroblasts on endothelial cells. Therefore,
      Givinostat may have potential for the treatment of CVDs.

TI  - Prevalence and clinical outcomes of white-coat and masked hypertension: Analysis 
      of a large ambulatory blood pressure database.
LID - 10.1111/jch.13181 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze prevalence and clinical outcomes of the
      following clinical conditions: normotension (NT; clinic BP < 140/90 mm Hg;
      24-hour BP < 130/80 mm Hg), white-coat hypertension (WCHT; clinic BP >/= 140
      and/or >/=90 mm Hg; 24-hour BP < 130/80 mm Hg), masked hypertension (MHT; clinic 
      BP < 140/90 mm Hg; 24-hour BP >/= 130 and/or >/=80 mm Hg), and sustained
      hypertension (SHT; clinic BP >/= 140 and/or >/=90 mm Hg; 24-hour BP >/= 130
      and/or >/=80 mm Hg) in a large cohort of adult untreated individuals. Systematic 
      research throughout the medical database of Regione Lazio (Italy) was performed
      to estimate incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and hospitalizations
      for HT and heart failure (HF). Among a total study sample of 2209 outpatients,
      377 (17.1%) had NT, 351 (15.9%) had WCHT, 149 (6.7%) had MHT, and 1332 had
      (60.3%) SHT. During an average follow-up of 120.1 +/- 73.9 months, WCHT was
      associated with increased risk of hospitalization for HT (OR 95% CI: 1.927
      [1.233-3.013]; P = .04) and HF (OR 95% CI: 3.449 [1.321-9.007]; P = .011). MHT
      was associated with an increased risk of MI (OR 95% CI: 5.062 [2.218-11.550]; P <
      .001), hospitalization for HT (OR 95% CI: 2.553 [1.446-4.508]; P = .001), and for
      HF (OR 95% CI: 4.214 [1.449-12.249]; P = .008). These effects remained
      statistically significant event after corrections for confounding factors
      including age, BMI, gender, smoking, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and presence of
      antihypertensive therapies.

TI  - Right heart remodeling induced by arterial hypertension: Could strain assessment 
      be helpful?
LID - 10.1111/jch.13186 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular structural and functional changes in patients with arterial
      hypertension are well established. However, the influence of arterial
      hypertension on right ventricular (RV) remodeling is still being investigated.
      The introduction of strain analysis provided an insight into RV function and
      mechanics. Previous research has demonstrated the predictive value of RV
      longitudinal strain in patients with various cardiovascular conditions, such as
      pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, congenital heart diseases, and valvular
      disease. Nowadays, we are aware of the fact that conventional echocardiographic
      methods usually do not provide necessary information about RV dysfunction in
      patients with arterial hypertension, which is why the evaluation of new
      parameters that could detect RV subtle changes in hypertension is essential. The 
      present review article is an overview of the main principles of RV deformation
      and a summary of the current knowledge and clinical significance of RV strain in 
      patients with arterial hypertension.

TI  - Left atrial appendage resection can be performed minimally invasively with good
      clinical and echocardiographic outcomes without any severe risk.
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezx506 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The adverse effects of left atrial appendage (LAA) closure have not
      yet been evaluated. This study aimed to prove the safety and low invasiveness of 
      LAA resection through our thoracoscopic stand-alone left atrial appendectomy
      experience. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients [mean age 68 +/- 9 years, 68 men
      (78%), mean congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >/= 75 years, diabetes
      mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack to thromboembolism, vascular
      disease, age 65-74 years and sex category (CHA2DS2-VASc) score 2.9 +/- 1.6
      points] who had undergone thoracoscopic left atrial appendectomy were selected.
      The operative and clinical data (left atrial diameter, left ventricular diameter 
      of systole/diastole, ejection fraction, brain natriuretic peptide and human
      atrial natriuretic peptide) were evaluated. All procedures were performed without
      cardiopulmonary bypass or cardiac arrest. The LAA was resected with an endoscopic
      linear cutter device. Except for 1 case with severe pleural adhesion, all
      operations were performed thoracoscopically. RESULTS: The preoperative and
      postoperative data are as follows: left atrial diameter 43 +/- 5 mm and 43 +/- 5 
      mm (P = 0.8); left ventricular diameter of systole/diastole 50 +/- 5/35 +/- 6 mm 
      and 48 +/- 5/34 +/- 6 mm (P < 0.01); ejection fraction 57 +/- 10% and 56 +/- 10% 
      (P = 0.11); brain natriuretic peptide 97 +/- 77 pg/ml and 72 +/- 65 pg/ml (P <
      0.01) and human atrial natriuretic peptide 73 +/- 64 pg/ml and 96 +/- 67 pg/ml (P
      = 0.03), respectively. The mean volume of bleeding in the operation was very
      small (<10 ml). The mean length of postoperative in-hospital stay was 3.8 +/- 1.8
      days. All the patients were discharged while maintaining their preoperative
      activities of daily living without major complications. No thrombus or residual
      stumps were detected during the 3-month postoperative computed tomography
      follow-up. The perioperative heart function did not change significantly in this 
      study. Bleeding with resection was minimal, and no rebleeding events occurred.
      CONCLUSIONS: LAA resection did not affect negatively on the cardiac function and 
      did not increase the risk of bleeding risk.

TI  - Organ-level right ventricular dysfunction with preserved Frank-Starling mechanism
      in a mouse model of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00725.2017 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly fatal disease in which
      mortality is due to right ventricular (RV) failure. It is unclear whether RV
      dysfunction initiates at the organ-level or the subcellular-level or both. We
      hypothesized that chronic pressure overload-induced RV dysfunction begins at the 
      organ level with preserved Frank-Starling mechanism in myocytes. To test this
      hypothesis, we induced PAH with SUGEN+hypoxia (HySu) in mice and measured RV
      whole-organ and subcellular functional changes by in vivo pressure-volume
      measurements and in vitro trabeculae length-tension measurements, respectively at
      multiple time points for up to 56 days. We observed progressive changes in RV
      function at the organ-level: in contrast to early PAH (14-day HySu), in late PAH 
      (56-day HySu) ejection fraction and ventricular-vascular coupling were decreased.
      At the subcellular level, direct measurements of myofilament contraction showed
      that RV contractile force was similarly increased at any stage of PAH
      development. Moreover, cross-bridge kinetics were not changed and
      length-dependence of force development (Frank-Starling relation) were not
      different from baseline in any PAH group. Histological examinations confirmed
      increased cardiomyocyte cross-section area and decreased von Willebrand Factor
      expression in RVs with PAH. In summary, RV dysfunction developed at the organ
      level with preserved Frank-Starling mechanism in myofilaments, and these results 
      provide novel insight into the development of RV dysfunction, which is critical
      to understanding the mechanisms of RV failure.

TI  - The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the United States.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2018.1433141 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The retrospective study aimed to estimate prevalence of hyperkalemia
      using a large US commercial claims database. METHODS: Adults with serum potassium
      lab data (2010 to 2014) and >/=1 calendar year of data were included from a large
      US commercial claims database. Hyperkalemia was defined as >/=2 serum potassium
      measurements >5.0 mEq/L or one hyperkalemia diagnosis code [ICD-9-CM, 276.7)] or 
      one sodium polystyrene sulfonate fill. Hyperkalemia prevalence was estimated for 
      the overall population and subgroups with hyperkalemia-related comorbidities by
      calendar year. Hyperkalemia prevalence was also standardized to the US population
      to estimate the number of US adults with hyperkalemia. RESULTS: The analysis
      included 2,270,635 patients (2010-2014). The annual prevalence of hyperkalemia in
      the overall population was 1.57% in 2014, with higher rates observed in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension.
      Among patients with CKD and/or heart failure, the 2014 annual prevalence was
      6.35%. Among patients with hyperkalemia, 48.43% had CKD and/or heart failure in
      2014. The prevalence of hyperkalemia was higher in patients with more severe CKD,
      as well as older patients and men. Extrapolating those results to the US
      population supports that 1.55% or 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia in 2014.
      CONCLUSIONS: An estimated 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia in 2014, and
      this prevalence rate has increased since 2010. In patients with CKD and/or heart 
      failure, the annual prevalence of hyperkalemia was 6.35% in 2014, and about half 
      of all patients with hyperkalemia have either CKD and/or heart failure.

TI  - Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is less prevalent in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome 
      than cirrhosis of liver.
LID - 10.1007/s12664-017-0811-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM) is associated with high
      mortality after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and liver
      transplantation in patients with cirrhosis. There is no data about the prevalence
      or impact of CCM in Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). We assessed the prevalence of CCM
      in patients with BCS and its impact on outcome after radiological intervention.
      METHODS: Thirty-three consecutive patients with BCS (15 men) and 33 controls with
      hepatitis B-related cirrhosis (18 men, matched for Child-Pugh score) were
      evaluated with baseline electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography (ECHO) and
      dobutamine stress ECHO, and ECG (DSE). The two groups were compared for
      prevalence of CCM. Patients with BCS with and without CCM were assessed for
      development of heart failure, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and
      in-hospital mortality immediately after radiological intervention. RESULTS: Fewer
      patients with BCS had CCM (7/21 vs. 21/33; p = 0.001, OR-0.16, CI [0.05-0.5]),
      diastolic dysfunction (DD) (0/33 vs. 6/33; p = 0.01, OR-0.06, CI [0.00-1.1]), and
      prolonged QTc interval (5/33 vs.17/33; p = 0.001, OR-0.16, CI [0.05-0.5]) despite
      correction for age. Patients with BCS had lower end-systolic and end-diastolic
      volumes of left and right ventricles. None of the 19 patients (five with CCM)
      with BCS undergoing radiological intervention (12 TIPS, 4 inferior vena cava, and
      3 hepatic vein stenting) developed heart failure or had prolonged ICU stay. There
      was no in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with BCS have lower frequency 
      of CCM as compared to patients with cirrhosis. CCM may not adversely affect
      outcomes after radiological interventions.
