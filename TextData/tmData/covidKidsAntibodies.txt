AB  - An outbreak related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. An extremely high 
      potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are 
      validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in 
      large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it 
      works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A 
      large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 
      1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza 
      RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in 
      COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not 
      shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen 
      of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. 
      Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus 
      azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2-5), which 
      showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 
      potency in vitro. The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure 
      in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of 
      SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation. Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II 
      type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA 
      viruses. Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and 
      -OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can 
      spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently 
      causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other 
      countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause 
      respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a 
      common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. SARS-CoV, 
      MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer 
      symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are 
      associated with much lower case-fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests 
      children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are 
      less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of 
      children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have 
      gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS-CoV present 
      with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children 
      affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel 
      CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In 
      contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize 
      epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention 
      options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on 
      infections in children.

AB  - A hyperinflammatory syndrome (HIS) may cause a life-threatening acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A prospective series 
      of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the Spedali Civili University Hospital in 
      Brescia (Italy) between March 9th and March 20th with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia 
      and ARDS requiring ventilatory support was analyzed to determine whether intravenous 
      administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the 
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, was associated with improved outcome. Tocilizumab was 
      administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg by two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h 
      apart. A third infusion was optional based on clinical response. The outcome measure 
      was an improvement in acute respiratory failure assessed by means of the Brescia 
      COVID Respiratory Severity Score (BCRSS 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher 
      severity) at 24-72 h and 10 days after tocilizumab administration. Out of 100 
      treated patients (88 M, 12 F; median age: 62 years), 43 received TCZ in the 
      intensive care unit (ICU), while 57 in the general ward as no ICU beds were 
      available. Of these 57 patients, 37 (65%) improved and suspended noninvasive 
      ventilation (NIV) (median BCRSS: 1 [IQR 0-2]), 7 (12%) patients remained stable in 
      NIV, and 13 (23%) patients worsened (10 died, 3 were admitted to ICU). Of the 43 
      patients treated in the ICU, 32 (74%) improved (17 of them were taken off the 
      ventilator and were discharged to the ward), 1 (2%) remained stable (BCRSS: 5) and 
      10 (24%) died (all of them had BCRSS≥7 before TCZ). Overall at 10 days, the 
      respiratory condition was improved or stabilized in 77 (77%) patients, of whom 61 
      showed a significant clearing of diffuse bilateral opacities on chest x-ray and 15 
      were discharged from the hospital. Respiratory condition worsened in 23 (23%) 
      patients, of whom 20 (20%) died. All the patients presented with lymphopenia and 
      high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, ferritin and IL-6 indicating a 
      HIS. During the 10-day follow-up, three cases of severe adverse events were 
      recorded: two patients developed septic shock and died, one had gastrointestinal 
      perforation requiring urgent surgery and was alive at day 10. In conclusion, our 
      series showed that COVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS was characterized by HIS. The 
      response to TCZ was rapid, sustained, and associated with significant clinical 
      improvement.

AB  - The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, can cause a potentially fatal disease, COVID-19, 
      in humans. Here, we will provide an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19. 
      Plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies against 
      SARS-CoV2 has shown promising results in patients with severe COVID-19. Also, IVIG, 
      combined with moderate-dose of corticosteroids, might improve patient outcomes. 
      Evidence links COVID-19 to variable degrees of inflammation. Studies show that the 
      use of corticosteroids might accelerate recovery from COVID-19. There are, however, 
      no controlled clinical trials that show whether the use of corticosteroids can 
      reduce COVID-19-related death. Also, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is the 
      best-documented cytokine in COVID-19 correlated with severity, criticality, viral 
      load, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody 
      against IL6, could confer clinical benefit in patients with high IL6 levels. 
      Essential elements that process SARS-CoV2 cell entry and specific characteristics 
      that allow SARS-CoV2 to escape the immune system have the potential as targets for 
      COVID-19 therapy.

TI  - Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children during the covid-19 
      pandemic in Paris, France: prospective observational study.
PG  - m2094

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of children and adolescents affected by 
      an outbreak of Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome and to evaluate a 
      potential temporal association with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: General 
      paediatric department of a university hospital in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: 21 
      children and adolescents (aged ≤18 years) with features of Kawasaki disease who were 
      admitted to hospital between 27 April and 11 May 2020 and followed up until 
      discharge by 15 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were clinical 
      and biological data, imaging and echocardiographic findings, treatment, and 
      outcomes. Nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively tested for SARS-CoV-2 using 
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and blood samples were 
      tested for IgG antibodies to the virus. RESULTS: 21 children and adolescents (median 
      age 7.9 (range 3.7-16.6) years) were admitted with features of Kawasaki disease over 
      a 15 day period, with 12 (57%) of African ancestry. 12 (57%) presented with Kawasaki 
      disease shock syndrome and 16 (76%) with myocarditis. 17 (81%) required intensive 
      care support. All 21 patients had noticeable gastrointestinal symptoms during the 
      early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. 19 (90%) had 
      evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR result in 8/21, positive 
      IgG antibody detection in 19/21). All 21 patients received intravenous 
      immunoglobulin and 10 (48%) also received corticosteroids. The clinical outcome was 
      favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 
      (24%) of the patients during hospital stay. By 15 May 2020, after 8 (5-17) days of 
      hospital stay, all patients were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing outbreak 
      of Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome among children and adolescents in 
      the Paris area might be related to SARS-CoV-2. In this study an unusually high 
      proportion of the affected children and adolescents had gastrointestinal symptoms, 
      Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and were of African ancestry.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest infectious challenges in recent 
      history. Presently, few treatment options exist and the availability of effective 
      vaccines is at least one year away. There is an urgent need to find currently 
      available, effective therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. 
      In this review, we compare and contrast the use of intravenous immunoglobulin and 
      hyperimmune globulin in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.

PG  - e440-e469

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
      affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians 
      caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. METHODS: We formed a panel of 36 
      experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization 
      conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are 
      relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for 
      direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill 
      patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most 
      questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence 
      using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
      approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and 
      harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were 
      either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. RESULTS: The 
      Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are 
      best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak 
      recommendations. No recommendation was provided for six questions. The topics were:

TI  - Surviving Sepsis Campaign: guidelines on the management of critically ill adults 
      with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
PG  - 854-887

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
      affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians 
      caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. METHODS: We formed a panel of 36 
      experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization 
      conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are 
      relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for 
      direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill 
      patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most 
      questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence 
      using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
      approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and 
      harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were 
      either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. RESULTS: The 
      Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best 
      practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. 
      No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection 
      control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) 
      ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy. CONCLUSION: The Surviving Sepsis 
      Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare 
      workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we 
      will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.

AB  - Coronavirus 2 (CoV) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV2) is causing a 
      highly infectious pandemic pneumonia. Coronaviruses are positive sense 
      single-stranded RNA viruses that infect several animal species, causing symptoms 
      that range from those similar to the common cold to severe respiratory syndrome. The 
      Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV2 functional receptor. 
      Measures are currently undertaken worldwide to control the infection to avoid 
      disruption of the social and economic equilibrium, especially in countries with poor 
      healthcare resources. In a guarded optimistic view, we hope that the undertaken 
      preventive and treatment measures will at least contribute to contain viral 
      diffusion, attenuate activity, or even eliminate SARS-CoV2. In this review, we 
      discuss emerging perspectives for prevention/treatment of COVID-19 infection. In 
      addition to vaccines under development, passive immunization is an open opportunity 
      since patients develop neutralizing antibodies. A full spectrum of potential drugs 
      for COVID-19 infections could in turn affect virus binding or enzymatic activities 
      involved in viral replication and transcription. Furthermore, clinical trials are 
      currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as 
      tocilizumab. Bioinformatics may allow characterization of specific CD8+ and CD4+ T 
      cell responses; thus, CoV2 T cells' frequency can be correlated with the disease 
      severity and outcome. Combinatorial antibody phage display may be empowered to 
      identify the immune repertoire of CoV2-specific neutralizing antibodies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the epidemiology and clinical course of multisystem 
      inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and its temporal association with 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is important, given the clinical and public 
      health implications of the syndrome. METHODS: We conducted targeted surveillance for 
      MIS-C from March 15 to May 20, 2020, in pediatric health centers across the United 
      States. The case definition included six criteria: serious illness leading to 
      hospitalization, an age of less than 21 years, fever that lasted for at least 24 
      hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, multisystem organ involvement, and 
      evidence of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 
      antibody testing, or exposure to persons with Covid-19 in the past month. Clinicians 
      abstracted the data onto standardized forms. RESULTS: We report on 186 patients with 
      MIS-C in 26 states. The median age was 8.3 years, 115 patients (62%) were male, 135 
      (73%) had previously been healthy, 131 (70%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR 
      or antibody testing, and 164 (88%) were hospitalized after April 16, 2020. 
      Organ-system involvement included the gastrointestinal system in 171 patients (92%), 
      cardiovascular in 149 (80%), hematologic in 142 (76%), mucocutaneous in 137 (74%), 
      and respiratory in 131 (70%). The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days 
      (interquartile range, 4 to 10); 148 patients (80%) received intensive care, 37 (20%) 
      received mechanical ventilation, 90 (48%) received vasoactive support, and 4 (2%) 
      died. Coronary-artery aneurysms (z scores ≥2.5) were documented in 15 patients (8%), 
      and Kawasaki's disease-like features were documented in 74 (40%). Most patients (171 
      [92%]) had elevations in at least four biomarkers indicating inflammation. The use 
      of immunomodulating therapies was common: intravenous immune globulin was used in 
      144 (77%), glucocorticoids in 91 (49%), and interleukin-6 or 1RA inhibitors in 38 
      (20%). CONCLUSIONS: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with 
      SARS-CoV-2 led to serious and life-threatening illness in previously healthy 
      children and adolescents. (Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and

TI  - Neurologic and Radiographic Findings Associated With COVID-19 Infection in Children.
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.2687 [doi]
LID - e202687
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Neurological manifestations have been reported in adults with 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the highly pathogenic virus 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE: To report 
      the neurological manifestations of children with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: In this case-series study, patients younger than 18 years who 
      presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological symptoms to Great Ormond Street 
      Hospital for Children (London, UK) between March 1, 2020, and May 8, 2020, were 
      included after infection was confirmed by either a quantitative reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay by nasopharyngeal swab or a positive 
      test result for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Clinical and paraclinical features were retrieved from electronic patient 
      records. RESULTS: Of the 27 children with COVID-19 pediatric multisystem 
      inflammatory syndrome, 4 patients (14.8%) who were previously healthy had new-onset 
      neurological symptoms. Symptoms included encephalopathy, headaches, brainstem and 
      cerebellar signs, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. All 4 patients required 
      intensive care unit admission for the treatment of COVID-19 pediatric multisystem 
      inflammatory syndrome. Splenium signal changes were seen in all 4 patients on 
      magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. In the 2 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid 
      was tested, samples were acellular, with no evidence of infection on polymerase 
      chain reaction or culture (including negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction 
      results) and negative oligoclonal band test results. In all 3 patients who underwent 
      electroencephalography, a mild excess of slow activity was found. Tests for 
      N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and aquaporin-4 
      autoantibodies had negative results in all patients. In all 3 patients who underwent 
      nerve conduction studies and electromyography, mild myopathic and neuropathic 
      changes were seen. Neurological improvement was seen in all patients, with 2 making 
      a complete recovery by the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 
      case-series study, children with COVID-19 presented with new neurological symptoms 
      involving both the central and peripheral nervous systems and splenial changes on 
      imaging, in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Additional research is needed to 
      assess the association of neurological symptoms with immune-mediated changes among 
      children with COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to a severe inflammatory response 
      referred to as a cytokine storm. We describe a case of severe COVID-19 infection in 
      a recently diagnosed pediatric Crohn disease patient successfully treated with tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) blockade. The patient presented with 5 days of fever, 
      an erythematous maculopapular facial rash, and abdominal pain without respiratory 
      symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was positive. Despite inpatient 
      treatment for COVID-19 and a perianal abscess, the patient acutely decompensated, 
      with worsening fever, tachycardia, fluid-refractory hypotension, elevation of liver 
      enzymes, and transformation of the rash into purpura extending from the face to the 
      trunk, upper and lower extremities, including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the 
      hands and feet. Cytokine profile revealed rising levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, 
      and TNF-α, higher than those described in either inflammatory bowel disease or 
      severe COVID-19 alone. The patient was treated with infliximab for TNF-α blockade to 
      address both moderately to severely active Crohn disease and multisystem 
      inflammatory syndrome in children temporally related to COVID-19. Within hours of 
      infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension resolved. Cytokine profile 
      improved with normalization of TNF-α, a decrease in IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations. 
      This case supports a role for blockade of TNF-α in the treatment of COVID-19 
      inflammatory cascade. The role of anti-TNF agents in patients with multisystem 
      inflammatory syndrome in children temporally related to COVID-19 requires further 
      investigation.

AB  - Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has attracted much attention around the world 
      due to its rapid transmission among humans and relatively high mortality rate. 
      Studies are increasing to find the best therapeutic approach for the disease and its 
      management. Regenerative medicine offers various cell-tissue therapeutics and 
      related products, such as stem cell therapy, natural killer (NK) cell therapy, 
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, exosomes, and tissue products. 
      Interestingly, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reduce inflammatory symptoms and 
      protect against cytokine storm, which critically contributes to the COVID-19 
      progression. Notably, having the potentials to exert cytotoxic effects on infected 
      cells and induce interferon production probably make NK cells a candidate for 
      COVID-19 cell therapy. Besides, exosomes are one of the crucial products of cells 
      that can exert therapeutic effects through the induction of immune responses and 
      neutralizing antibody titers. The paper aims to briefly consider current options for 
      COVID-19 therapy to show that there is no specific cure for COVID-19, and then 
      assess the real opportunities and range of promises regenerative medicine can 
      provide for specific treatment of COVID-19. Graphical Abstract Therapeutic Potential 
      of Regenerative Medicine against COVID19.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently 
      spread worldwide and been declared a pandemic. We aim to describe here the various 
      clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases. METHODS: 
      Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and 
      demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and 
      radiological images are discussed. RESULTS: The clinical course of the eleven cases 
      demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical 
      presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients 
      with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of 
      the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of 
      virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for 
      diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms 
      and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more 
      severe. CONCLUSION: All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be 
      taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine 
      for the efficient containment of the pandemic.

AB  - In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2)(1), a pandemic. With rapidly accumulating numbers of cases and deaths 
      reported globally(2), a vaccine is urgently needed. Here we report the available 
      safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, 
      observer-blinded dose-escalation study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04368728) 
      among 45 healthy adults (18-55 years of age), who were randomized to receive 2 
      doses-separated by 21 days-of 10 μg, 30 μg or 100 μg of BNT162b1. BNT162b1 is a 
      lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the 
      trimerized receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. 
      Local reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, 
      and transient. A second vaccination with 100 μg was not administered because of the 
      increased reactogenicity and a lack of meaningfully increased immunogenicity after a 
      single dose compared with the 30-μg dose. RBD-binding IgG concentrations and 
      SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titres in sera increased with dose level and after a second 
      dose. Geometric mean neutralizing titres reached 1.9-4.6-fold that of a panel of 
      COVID-19 convalescent human sera, which were obtained at least 14 days after a 
      positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. These results support further evaluation of this mRNA 
      vaccine candidate.

AB  - Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are 
      associated with age. While children are largely spared from severe respiratory 
      disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory 
      syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki's disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) 
      responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild 
      disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific 
      antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C 
      predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the 
      nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA 
      Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing 
      activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological 
      response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in 
      children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing 
      treatments based on symptom and age.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-coronavirus causing over 200.000 lethal cases within six 
      months of first infecting humans. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a form of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is characterized by two phases: the first 
      resembles the flu with pneumonia, but after about seven or eight days the disease 
      suddenly worsens to a sepsis-like syndrome. It is difficult to explain this 
      virus-immune-pathology sequence from virology or immunology only. This paper 
      hypothesizes that host-produced anti-spike protein antibodies are responsible for 
      immune-induced viral dissemination. Subsequently, systemic distribution of 
      virus-antibodies complexes activates the immune pathology observed in severe 
      COVID-19. This hypothesis may be counterintuitive to immunologist that consider many 
      anti-spike antibodies to be virus-neutralizing antibodies. Although anti-spike 
      antibodies may hinder infection of epithelial cells, antibody binding to the spike 
      protein may facilitate virus infection of myeloid leukocytes. If myeloid leukocytes 
      reenter the circulation, they could spread the virus from a locoregional infection 
      to a systemic disease. Disseminated virus in combination with antibodies results in 
      dispersed virus-antibody complexes that overstimulate the immune system. The 
      hypothesis aligns with the sequences of virus, immune and pathological events in 
      COVID-19. The delay in onset from both syndromes results from an immune system still 
      naïve to the non-cross-reactive spike protein. Details of this hypothesis are in 
      concordance with many clinical characteristics of COVID-19, including its 
      predominant lethality for the elderly, and the mostly asymptomatic course of disease 
      in children. It predicts putative detrimental effects of vaccines that induce 
      virus-neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein, as has been shown for other 
      coronaviruses. This hypothesis has consequences for treatment of patients, 
      evaluation of personal and herd immunity and vaccine development. In patients, 
      cellular immunity should be stimulated. Neutralizing antibodies might not be 
      indicative for immunity. Vaccines should aim to stimulate cellular immunity COVID-19 
      and/or stimulate humoral immunity against viral proteins except for the 
      immunodominant spike protein.

AB  - The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made the development of a 
      vaccine a top biomedical priority. In this study, we developed a series of DNA 
      vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein 
      and evaluated them in 35 rhesus macaques. Vaccinated animals developed humoral and 
      cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibody titers at levels 
      comparable to those found in convalescent humans and macaques infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2. After vaccination, all animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2, and the 
      vaccine encoding the full-length S protein resulted in >3.1 and >3.7 log(10) 
      reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa, 
      respectively, as compared with viral loads in sham controls. Vaccine-elicited 
      neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protective efficacy, suggesting an 
      immune correlate of protection. These data demonstrate vaccine protection against 
      SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is expanding rapidly, which made it as one of 
      top priorities for scientists to develop novel treatment strategies. Researchers are 
      racing to develop treatments based on antibodies to block and/or neutralize the 
      coronavirus in affected patients. Initially, the genetic and structural similarity 
      of the virus to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) created the 
      potential for understanding disease pathogenesis. Researchers have published reports 
      of specific monoclonal antibodies against to COVID-19 (B38, H4, 47D11) and hope that 
      this method is effective. As well as studies on patients who are plasma therapy, the 
      patient's condition shows improvement. The evidence for these studies is very 
      promising and demonstrates the potential of monoclonal antibody therapy as a 
      therapeutic approach and prevention of covid-19 infection.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic, but human immune 
      responses to the virus remain poorly understood. We used high-dimensional cytometry 
      to analyze 125 COVID-19 patients and compare them with recovered and healthy 
      individuals. Integrated analysis of ~200 immune and ~50 clinical features revealed 
      activation of T cell and B cell subsets in a proportion of patients. A subgroup of 
      patients had T cell activation characteristic of acute viral infection and 
      plasmablast responses reaching >30% of circulating B cells. However, another 
      subgroup had lymphocyte activation comparable with that in uninfected individuals. 
      Stable versus dynamic immunological signatures were identified and linked to 
      trajectories of disease severity change. Our analyses identified three immunotypes 
      associated with poor clinical trajectories versus improving health. These 
      immunotypes may have implications for the design of therapeutics and vaccines for 
      COVID-19.

AB  - The global fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is largely based on 
      strategies to boost immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and prevent its severe course and complications. The 
      human defence may include antibodies which interact with SARS-CoV-2 and neutralize 
      its aggressive actions on multiple organ systems. Protective cross-reactivity of 
      antibodies against measles and other known viral infections has been postulated, 
      primarily as a result of the initial observations of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 
      in children. Uncontrolled case series have demonstrated virus-neutralizing effect of 
      convalescent plasma, supporting its efficiency at early stages of contracting 
      SARS-CoV-2. Given the variability of the virus structure, the utility of 
      convalescent plasma is limited to the geographic area of its preparation, and for a 
      short period of time. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also be protective in view of 
      its nonspecific antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. Finally, human monoclonal 
      antibodies may interact with some SARS-CoV-2 proteins, inhibiting the virus-receptor 
      interaction and prevent tissue injury. The improved understanding of the host 
      antiviral responses may help develop safe and effective immunotherapeutic strategies 
      against COVID-19 in the foreseeable future.

AB  - The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally coupled with the relatively high 
      case-fatality rate has led to immediate need for therapeutic intervention to prevent 
      and treat COVID-19 disease. There is accumulating evidence that morbidity and 
      mortality in COVID-19 may be exacerbated by a dysregulated host immune response 
      resulting in significant hyperinflammation and cytokine release. The aim of this 
      review is to describe the basis for the immune dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and to examine current investigations into immunomodulatory therapies 
      aimed at targeting the excessive host immune response.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread 
      worldwide. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, understanding the in vivo 
      characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority. We report a ferret model of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease. 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus 
      replication. Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed 
      virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection. At 
      2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets. 
      Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, 
      suggesting airborne transmission. Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, 
      trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs. 
      Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of COVID-19 that 
      may facilitate development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.

AB  - The incidence of COVID-19 in children and teenagers is only about 2% in China. 
      Children had mild symptoms and hardly infected other children or adults. It is worth 
      considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but 
      fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the 
      pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads 
      to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children 
      differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations 
      or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens 
      infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune 
      fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. 
      Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, 
      influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line 
      health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, for high-risk 
      susceptible populations, such as the elderly with basic diseases such as 
      hypertension and diabetes, it is necessary to explore the remedial effect of the 
      planned immune process on their immunity to achieve the trained immunity or immune 
      fitness, so as to improve their own antiviral ability.

TI  - The first, holistic immunological model of COVID-19: Implications for prevention,

PG  - 454-470

AB  - The natural history of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is extremely variable, ranging 
      from asymptomatic or mild infection, mainly in children, to multi-organ failure, 
      eventually fatal, mainly in the eldest. We propose here the first model explaining 
      how the outcome of first, crucial 10-15 days after infection, depends on the balance 
      between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate 
      immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, mannose-binding lectin). If 
      SARS-CoV-2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper 
      airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with 
      no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens. The 
      delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high-affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) 
      that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, 
      coagulation, and cytokine storm), leading to complications often requiring intensive 
      therapy and being, in some patients, fatal. Low-moderate physical activity can still 
      be recommended. However, extreme physical activity and oral breathing with 
      hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID-19 facilitates 
      re-inhalation and early direct penetration of high numbers of own virus particles in 
      the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway's mucosae covered 
      by neutralizing antibodies ("viral auto-inhalation" phenomenon). This allows the 
      virus to bypass the efficient immune barrier of the upper airway mucosa in already 
      infected, young, and otherwise healthy athletes. In conclusion, whether the virus or 
      the adaptive immune response reaches the lungs first is a crucial factor deciding 
      the fate of the patient. This "quantitative and time-/sequence-dependent" model has 
      several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19 at all ages.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant global event in the history of infectious 
      diseases. The SARS-CoV-2 appears to have originated from bats but is now easily 
      transmissible among humans, primarily through droplet or direct contact. Clinical 
      features of COVID-19 include high fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to 
      ARDS. Respiratory failure can occur rapidly after this. The primary laboratory 
      findings include lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin, and 
      CRP levels may correlate with disease severity. Imaging findings include 
      ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation on CT scan. Mortality is higher in 
      patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and COPD. 
      Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children 
      seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality. Diagnostic criteria and 
      the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has 
      emerged. However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to 
      region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city. The 
      importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant 
      diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus 
      that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.

AB  - The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented major challenges for 
      clinical laboratories, from initial diagnosis to patient monitoring and treatment. 
      Initial response to this pandemic involved the development, production, and 
      distribution of diagnostic molecular assays at an unprecedented rate, leading to 
      minimal validation requirements and concerns regarding their diagnostic accuracy in 
      clinical settings. In addition to molecular testing, serological assays to detect 
      antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are 
      now becoming available from numerous diagnostic manufacturers. In both cases, the 
      lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general 
      misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of 
      laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for 
      appropriate clinical use. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and 
      Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize 
      up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis 
      and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the 
      use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and 
      management. This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, 
      serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key 
      considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight 
      against this ongoing pandemic. Confidently this consolidated information provides a 
      useful resource to laboratories and a reminder of the laboratory's critical role as 
      the world battles this unprecedented crisis.

TI  - The clinical and immunological features of pediatric COVID-19 patients in China.

AB  - In December 2019, the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by novel 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread worldwide. Few 
      information on clinical features and immunological profile of COVID-19 in 
      paediatrics. The clinical features and treatment outcomes of twelve paediatric 
      patients confirmed as COVID-19 were analyzed. The immunological features of children 
      patients was investigated and compared with twenty adult patients. The median age 
      was 14.5-years (range from 0.64 to 17), and six of the patients were male. The 
      average incubation period was 8 days. Clinically, cough (9/12, 75%) and fever (7/12, 
      58.3%) were the most common symptoms. Four patients (33.3%) had diarrhea during the 
      disease. As to the immune profile, children had higher amount of total T cell, CD8+ 
      T cell and B cell but lower CRP levels than adults (P < 0.05). Ground-glass opacity 
      (GGO) and local patchy shadowing were the typical radiological findings on chest CT 
      scan. All patients received antiviral and symptomatic treatment and the symptom 
      relieved in 3-4 days after admitted to hospital. The paediatric patients showed mild 
      symptom but with longer incubation period. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 had 
      different immune profile with higher T cell amount and low inflammatory factors 
      level, which might ascribed to the mild clinical symptom. We advise that nucleic 
      acid test or examination of serum IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be 
      taken for children with exposure history regardless of clinical symptom.

TI  - Kawasaki-like diseases and thrombotic coagulopathy in COVID-19: delayed 
      over-activation of the STING pathway?
PG  - 1514-1522
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1785336 [doi]
AB  - We previously made the hypothesis that STING contributes to COVID-19. The present 
      review detail new arguments for over-activation of STING pathways in COVID-19, 
      following the description of hyper-coagulability and Kawasaki-like diseases in 
      children. Indeed, Kawasaki disease is induced by overreaction of innate cells 
      following exposition to various viruses, including herpes viruses which trigger 
      STING. It predisposes to diffuse vasculitis and aneurysms, whereas STING is 
      over-expressed in arterial aneurisms. The redness at the inoculation site of 
      bacillus Calmette-Guérin, a specific feature of Kawasaki disease, is reproduced by 
      activation of the STING pathway, which is inhibited upstream by aspirin, intravenous 
      immunoglobulins, and Vitamin-D. SARS-CoV2 binding to ACE2 can lead to excessive 
      angiotensin II signaling, which activates the STING pathway in mice. Over-activation 
      of the STING-pathway promotes hyper-coagulability through release of interferon-β 
      and tissue factor by monocytes-macrophages. Aspirin and dipyridamole, besides their 
      anti-platelet activity, also reduce tissue factor procoagulant activity, and aspirin 
      inhibits the STING pathway upstream of STING. Aspirin and dipyridamole may be used, 
      in combination with drugs blocking downstream the activation of the STING pathway, 
      like inhibitors of IL-6R and JAK/STAT pathways. The risk of bleeding should be low 
      as bleeding has not been reported in severe COVID-19 patients.

      antibodies and protective immunity with minimal immunopathology in mice after a 
      homologous virus challenge with SARS-CoV (MA15 strain). We examined published 
      evidence in support of whether the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 could be repurposed as a 
      heterologous vaccine against Coronavirus Infectious Disease (COVID)-19. Our findings 
      include evidence that convalescent serum from SARS-CoV patients can neutralize 
      SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a review of published studies using monoclonal antibodies 
      (mAbs) raised against SARS-CoV RBD and that neutralizes the SARS-CoV virus in vitro 
      finds that some of these mAbs bind to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the 
      RBD, while others bind to domains outside this region within RBD. This information 
      is relevant and supports the possibility of developing a heterologous SARS-CoV RBD 
      vaccine against COVID-19, especially due to the finding that the overall high amino 
      acid similarity (82%) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD domains is not 
      reflected in RBM amino acid similarity (59%). However, the high sequence similarity 
      (94%) in the region outside of RBM offers the potential of conserved neutralizing 
      epitopes between both viruses.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted the 
      delivery of cellular therapeutics, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T 
      cells. This impact has extended beyond patient care to include logistics, 
      administration, and distribution of increasingly limited health care resources. 
      Based on the collective experience of the CAR T-cell Consortium investigators, we 
      review and address several questions and concerns regarding cellular therapy 
      administration in the setting of COVID-19 and make general recommendations to 
      address these issues. Specifically, we address (1) necessary resources for safe 
      administration of cell therapies; (2) determinants of cell therapy utilization; (3) 
      selection among patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia; (4) supportive measures during cell therapy administration; 
      (5) use and prioritization of tocilizumab; and (6) collaborative care with referring 
      physicians. These recommendations were carefully formulated with the understanding 
      that resource allocation is of the utmost importance, and that the decision to 
      proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion of potential risks 
      and benefits. Although these recommendations are fluid, at this time it is our 
      opinion that the COVID-19 pandemic should not serve as reason to defer CAR T cell 
      therapy for patients truly in need of a potentially curative therapy.

TI  - Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children With COVID-19 in Mumbai, India.
LID - S097475591600230 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe the presentation, treatment and outcome of children with 
      multisystem inflammatory syndrome with COVID-19 (MIS-C) in Mumbai metropolitan area 
      in India. METHODS: This is an observational study conducted at four tertiary 
      hospitals in Mumbai. Parameters including demographics, symptomatology, laboratory 
      markers, medications and outcome were obtained from patient hospital records and 
      analyzed in patients treated for MIS-C (as per WHO criteria) from 1 May, 2020 to 15 
      July, 2020. RESULTS: 23 patients (11 males) with median (range) age of 7.2 (0.8-14) 
      years were included. COVID19 RT PCR or antibody was positive in 39.1% and 30.4%, 
      respectively; 34.8% had a positive contact. 65% patients presented in shock; these 
      children had a higher age (P=0.05), and significantly higher incidence of 
      myocarditis with elevated Troponin, NT pro BNP and LV dysfunction, along with 
      significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, as compared to those without shock. 
      Coronary artery dilation was seen in 26% patients overall. Steroids were used most 
      commonly for treatment (96%), usually along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 
      (65%). Outcome was good with only one death. CONCLUSION: Initial data on MIS-C from 
      India is presented. Further studies and longer surveillance of patients with MIS-C 
      are required to improve our diagnostic, treatment and surveillance criteria.

      protective role?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a novel disease entity that is 
      spreading throughout the world. It has been speculated that patients with 
      comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory 
      insufficiency and death. Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even 
      higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response. However, it 
      has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical 
      deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are 
      currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: In this paper 
      we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting 
      monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed 
      COVID-19. RESULTS: Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few 
      days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine. Phone 
      interview follow-up confirmed that, after 14 days, no new symptoms occurred. 
      DISCUSSION: This report supports the putative role of immunosuppressive therapy in 
      COVID-19 affected patients.

AB  - COVID-19 is a clinical syndrome ranging from mild symptoms to severe pneumonia that 
      often leads to respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. Most 
      of the lung damage is driven by a surge in inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-6, 
      interferon-γ, and granulocyte-monocyte stimulating factor (GM-CSF)]. Blunting this 
      hyperinflammation with immunomodulation may lead to clinical improvement. GM-CSF is 
      produced by many cells, including macrophages and T-cells. GM-CSF-derived signals 
      are involved in differentiation of macrophages, including alveolar macrophages 
      (AMs). In animal models of respiratory infections, the intranasal administration of 
      GM-CSF increased the proliferation of AMs and improved outcomes. Increased levels of 
      GM-CSF have been recently described in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy 
      controls. While GM-CSF might be beneficial in some circumstances as an appropriate 
      response, in this case the inflammatory response is maladaptive by virtue of being 
      later and disproportionate. The inhibition of GM-CSF signaling may be beneficial in 
      improving the hyperinflammation-related lung damage in the most severe cases of 
      COVID-19. This blockade can be achieved through antagonism of the GM-CSF receptor or 
      the direct binding of circulating GM-CSF. Initial findings from patients with 
      COVID-19 treated with a single intravenous dose of mavrilimumab, a monoclonal 
      antibody binding GM-CSF receptor α, showed oxygenation improvement and shorter 
      hospitalization. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are ongoing. 
      Anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies, TJ003234 and gimsilumab, will be tested in 
      clinical trials in patients with COVID-19, while lenzilumab received FDA approval 
      for compassionate use. These trials will help inform whether blunting the 
      inflammatory signaling provided by the GM-CSF axis in COVID-19 is beneficial.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of 182 pediatric COVID-19 patients with different 
      severities and allergic status.
LID - 10.1111/all.14452 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has made widespread 
      impact recently. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 
      children with different severities and allergic status. METHODS: Data extracted from 
      the electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, 
      comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results, and radiological images of 182 
      hospitalized COVID-19 children, were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median 
      age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys 
      (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children 
      were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common 
      symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including 
      diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed 
      tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground-glass 
      opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly 
      within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia 
      (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, 
      and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without 
      pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), 
      children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity 
      history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, 
      alkaline phosphatase, and serum interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. 
      There were no differences in treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from 
      first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children 
      with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children 
      had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic 
      children with COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by 
      drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma. Demographics and clinical 
      features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic groups. 
      Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, 
      D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all patients. 
      Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte subsets, total 
      immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not show any 
      difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum 
      total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other 
      immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte 
      subset numbers, and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID-19 patients 
      tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion 
      of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without 
      pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and nonallergic COVID-19 
      children in disease incidence, clinical features, and laboratory and immunological 
      findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID-19 in children.

TI  - COVID-19 in children: current evidence and key questions.
LID - 10.1097/QCO.0000000000000690 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children has been less well characterized 
      than in adults, primarily due to a significantly milder clinical phenotype meaning 
      many cases have gone undocumented by health professionals or researchers. This 
      review outlines the current evidence of the epidemiology of infection in children, 
      the clinical manifestations of disease, the role of children in transmission of the 
      virus and the recently described hyperinflammatory syndrome observed later during 
      the first phase of the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: International seroprevalence 
      studies have found younger children to have lower prevalence of antibodies to 
      SARS-CoV-2, indicating they have not been infected as much as adults. This may be 
      due to shielding by school closures, or by a reduced susceptibility to infection, as 
      indicated by a significantly lower attack rate in children than adults in household 
      contact tracing studies. The most well recognized symptoms in adults of cough, 
      fever, anosmia and ageusia are less frequent in children, who may often present with 
      mild and nonspecific symptoms, or with gastrointestinal symptoms alone. Risk factors 
      for severe disease in children include chronic lung, cardiac or neurological 
      disease, and malignancy. However, the absolute risk still appears very low for these 
      cohorts. A new hyperinflammatory syndrome has emerged with an apparent immune cause. 
      SUMMARY: Important questions remain unanswered regarding why children have mild 
      disease compared with adults; how children of different ages contribute to 
      asymptomatic community transmission of the virus; and the pathophysiology of and 
      most appropriate investigation and treatment strategies for the novel 
      hyperinflammatory syndrome.

AB  - A safe and effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) may be required to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      pandemic(1-8). For global deployment and pandemic control, a vaccine that requires 
      only a single immunization would be optimal. Here we show the immunogenicity and 
      protective efficacy of a single dose of adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based 
      vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in non-human primates. 
      Fifty-two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were immunized with Ad26 vectors that 
      encoded S variants or sham control, and then challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the 
      intranasal and intratracheal routes(9,10). The optimal Ad26 vaccine induced robust 
      neutralizing antibody responses and provided complete or near-complete protection in 
      bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Titres of 
      vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies correlated with protective efficacy, 
      suggesting an immune correlate of protection. These data demonstrate robust 
      single-shot vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. The optimal 
      Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being 
      evaluated in clinical trials.

AB  - The clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals infected with 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been well 
      described. We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were 
      diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant 
      clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic 
      individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People's Hospital for 
      centralized isolation in accordance with policy(1). The median duration of viral 
      shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15-26 d). 
      The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than 
      the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the 
      asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6-10.7) were significantly lower 
      (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8-38.2) in 
      the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% (28/30) and 81.1% (30/37) had 
      reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early 
      convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% (30/31) and 62.2% (23/37) of symptomatic 
      patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9% of 
      the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In 
      addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and 
      anti-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that asymptomatic individuals had a 
      weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reduction in IgG and 
      neutralizing antibody levels in the early convalescent phase might have implications 
      for immunity strategy and serological surveys.

TI  - Interleukin-6 and severe COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 44-49
LID - 10.1684/ecn.2020.0448 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence links COVID-19 severity to hyper-inflammation. Treatment with 
      tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
      receptor, was shown to lead to clinical improvement in patients with severe 
      COVID-19. We, therefore, performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis 
      to investigate whether the circulating levels of IL-6 is a reliable indicator of 
      disease severity among patients affected with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search 
      was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar on April 19, 
      2020. RESULTS: Eleven studies provided data of IL-6 levels in patients with severe 
      to critical COVID-19 (severe) and patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 
      (non-severe). The included studies were of moderate to high quality. The mean 
      patients' age was 60.9 years, ranging from 45.2 to 76.7 years in the severe group 
      and 46.8 years, ranging from 37.9 to 61 years, in the nonsevere group. Fifty-two 
      percent were male in the severe group, as compared to 46% in the non-severe group. 
      An overall random effects meta-analysis showed significantly higher serum levels of 
      IL-6 in the severe group than in the non-severe group with a mean difference of 
      +23.1 pg/mL (95% CI: 12.42-33.79) and the overall effect of 4.24 (P-value < 0.001). 
      Meta-regressions showed that neither age nor sex significantly influenced the mean 
      difference of IL-6 between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis and 
      meta-regression reveal a reliable relationship between IL-6 and COVID-19 severity, 
      independent of age and sex. Future research is, however, required to assess the 
      effect of BMI on the pattern of IL-6 production in patients with COVID-19. Also, 
      there might be confounding factors that influence the relationship between IL-6 and 
      COVID-19 severity and remain as yet unknown.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent increase in children admitted with hypotensive shock and fever 
      in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak requires an urgent characterization and 
      assessment of the involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is a case series 
      performed at 4 academic tertiary care centers in Paris of all the children admitted 
      to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with shock, fever and suspected 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 15th and April 27th, 2020. RESULTS: 20 critically 
      ill children admitted for shock had an acute myocarditis (left ventricular ejection 
      fraction, 35% (25-55); troponin, 269 ng/mL (31-4607)), and arterial hypotension with 
      mainly vasoplegic clinical presentation. The first symptoms before PICU admission 
      were intense abdominal pain and fever for 6 days (1-10). All children had highly 
      elevated C-reactive protein (> 94 mg/L) and procalcitonin (> 1.6 ng/mL) without 
      microbial cause. At least one feature of Kawasaki disease was found in all children 
      (fever, n = 20, skin rash, n = 10; conjunctivitis, n = 6; cheilitis, n = 5; 
      adenitis, n = 2), but none had the typical form. SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology were 
      positive for 10 and 15 children, respectively. One child had both negative 
      SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology, but had a typical SARS-CoV-2 chest tomography scan. All 
      children but one needed an inotropic/vasoactive drug support (epinephrine, n = 12; 
      milrinone, n = 10; dobutamine, n = 6, norepinephrine, n = 4) and 8 were intubated. 
      All children received intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g per kilogram) with adjuvant 
      corticosteroids (n = 2), IL 1 receptor antagonist (n = 1) or a monoclonal antibody 
      against IL-6 receptor (n = 1). All children survived and were afebrile with a full 
      left ventricular function recovery at PICU discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Acute myocarditis 
      with intense systemic inflammation and atypical Kawasaki disease is an emerging 
      severe pediatric disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early recognition of this 
      disease is needed and referral to an expert center is recommended. A delayed and 
      inappropriate host immunological response is suspected. While underlying mechanisms 
      remain unclear, further investigations are required to target an optimal treatment.

AB  - Today it remains unclear why children seem to be less likely to get infected by 
      COVID-19 or why they appear to be less symptomatic after infections. All 
      individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human 
      coronavirus (CoVs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. We hypothesize 
      that recurrent CoVs exposure may induce an effective antiviral B and T-cell-mediated 
      adaptive immune response, which could also be protective against COVID-19. Based on 
      the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related 
      coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with CoVs might shield 
      children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a possible neutralizing 
      antibody response previously CoVs-induced. This would open up possible lines of 
      research for the development of live-attenuated virus vaccines from CoVs. Future 
      research is desirable to confirm or disprove such hypothesis.

      Results of an online survey].

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliable data on the course and treatment of pediatric COVID-19 ("corona 
      virus disease 2019") in immunosuppressed patients with rheumatic diseases are 
      missing. AIM: Delineation of individual strategies of the members of the Society for 
      Pediatric Rheumatology (GKJR) in cases of COVID-19. METHODS: In May 2020 all GKJR 
      members were invited to take part in an online survey. Opinion data regarding an 
      approach using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) in cases of COVID-19 
      as well as the readiness to use new therapeutic agents in patients in different 
      stages of the disease were collected. RESULTS: A total of 71 respondents (27.3% of 
      all contacted pediatric rheumatologists) took part in the survey. Of these 28.2% had 
      treated patients with COVID-19. Over 95% of the respondents did not support 
      a preventive adaptation of the anti-rheumatic treatment during the SARS-CoV‑2 
      pandemic. In the case of outpatients under immunosuppression with proven COVID-19 
      more than 50% of the respondents would refrain from administering intravenous 
      high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, anti-CD20 antibodies as well as BAFF, CTLA‑4 
      and TNF-alpha blockades. Conversely, >70% of the respondents would continue the 
      treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), oral 
      steroids, mycophenolate, IL‑1 blockade and immunoglobulins (Ig). In the case of 
      inpatients 74.6% of respondents would consider targeted COVID-19 treatment. In 
      stable patients with oxygen treatment (stage I) HCQ (18.3%), azithromycin (16.9%) 
      and Ig (9.9%) were most frequently used. In cases of early signs (stage II) or a 
      manifest cytokine storm (stage III) anakinra (40.8% for stage II and 46.5% for 
      stage III), tocilizumab (26.8% and 40.8%, respectively), steroids (25.4% and 33.8%, 
      respectively) and remdesivir (29.6% and 38.0%, respectively) were most frequently 
      used. The need for a personalized approach based on the current clinical situation 
      was emphasized by many respondents. CONCLUSION: The currently low prevalence of 
      COVID-19 in Germany limits the general clinical experience. Therefore, the presented 
      results have to be interpreted with caution and mostly as hypothetical treatment 
      considerations. It is to be expected that there will always be a limited amount of 
      evidence on pediatric COVID-19; therefore, a continuous and critical exchange of 
      expert opinions on the treatment strategies is important.

AB  - The collapse of global cooperation and a failure of international solidarity have 
      led to many low-income and middle-income countries being denied access to molecular 
      diagnostics in the COVID-19 pandemic response. Yet the scarcity of knowledge on the 
      dynamics of the immune response to infection has led to hesitation on recommending 
      the use of rapid immunodiagnostic tests, even though rapid serology tests are 
      commercially available and scalable. On the basis of our knowledge and understanding 
      of viral infectivity and host response, we urge countries without the capacity to do 
      molecular testing at scale to research the use of serology tests to triage 
      symptomatic patients in community settings, to test contacts of confirmed cases, and 
      in situational analysis and surveillance. The WHO R&D Blue Print expert group 
      identified eight priorities for research and development, of which the highest is to 
      mobilise research on rapid point-of-care diagnostics for use at the community level. 
      This research should inform control programmes of the required performance and 
      utility of rapid serology tests, which, when applied specifically for appropriate 
      public health measures to then be put in place, can make a huge difference.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of clinically overt 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases 
      residing in Tuscany, and to compare it with that observed in the general Tuscan 
      population. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, Tuscan outpatients with systemic 
      autoimmune diseases followed at a tertiary referral centre were telephonically 
      interviewed between April 1st-14th 2020 to collect demographic and clinical data, 
      information on ongoing immunomodulating/immunosuppressive treatments, and on the 
      presence of symptoms suspected of SARS-CoV-2 or of a confirmed infection. RESULTS: 
      458 patients were interviewed [74% female, median age 56 years (IQR 43-68)]; 56% of 
      them were receiving corticosteroids, 44% traditional disease-modifying 
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), of whom 23% hydroxychloroquine, 5% colchicine, while 
      41% were on biologic DMARDs (of whom 9% on tocilizumab). Thirteen patients reported 
      symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of them, 7 had undergone nasopharyngeal 
      swab and only one was positive and developed severe SARS-CoV-2 complications. Within 
      our cohort, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was therefore 0.22% (0.01-1.21%), 
      comparable to that observed in the general population of Tuscany [0.20% 
      (0.20-0.21%), p = .597]. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases do 
      not seem to carry an increased risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection as compared to the 
      general population.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demanded rapid upscaling of 
      in-vitro diagnostic assays to enable mass screening and testing of high-risk groups, 
      and simultaneous ascertainment of robust data on past SARS-CoV-2 exposure at an 
      individual and a population level. To meet the exponential demand in testing, there 
      has been an accelerated development of both molecular and serological assays across 
      a plethora of platforms. The present review discusses the current literature on 
      these modalities, including nucleic acid amplification tests, direct viral antigen 
      tests and the rapidly expanding laboratory-based and point of care serological 
      tests. This suite of complementary tests will inform crucial decisions by healthcare 
      providers and policy makers, and understanding their strengths and limitations will 
      be critical to their judicious application for the development of algorithmic 
      approaches to treatment and public health strategies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Stage 1: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate agents as 
      add-on therapies to standard of care (SoC) in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in 
      a screening stage. Stage 2: To confirm the efficacy of candidate agents selected on 
      the basis of evidence from Stage 1 in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in an 
      expansion stage. TRIAL DESIGN: ACCORD is a seamless, Phase 2, adaptive, randomised 
      controlled platform study, designed to rapidly test candidate agents in the 
      treatment of COVID-19. Designed as a master protocol with each candidate agent being 
      included via its own sub-protocol, initially randomising equally between each 
      candidate and a single contemporaneous SoC arm (which can adapt into 2:1). Candidate 
      agents currently include bemcentinib, MEDI3506, acalabrutinib, zilucoplan and 
      nebulised heparin. For each candidate a total of 60 patients will be recruited in 
      Stage 1. If Stage 1 provides evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety the 
      candidate will enter Stage 2 where a total of approximately 126 patients will be 
      recruited into each study arm sub-protocol. Enrollees and outcomes will not be 
      shared across the Stages; the endpoint, analysis and sample size for Stage 2 may be 
      adjusted based on evidence from Stage 1. Additional arms may be added as new 
      potential candidate agents are identified via candidate agent specific 
      sub-protocols. PARTICIPANTS: The study will include hospitalised adult patients (≥18 
      years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, that 
      clinically meet Grades 3 (hospitalised - mild disease, no oxygen therapy), Grades 4 
      (hospitalised, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs) and 5 (hospitalised, non-invasive 
      ventilation or high flow oxygen) of the WHO Working Group on the Clinical 
      Characteristics of COVID-19 9-point category ordinal scale. Participants will be 
      recruited from England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. INTERVENTION AND 
      COMPARATOR: Comparator is current standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of 
      COVID-19. Current candidate experimental arms include bemcentinib, MEDI3506, 
      acalabrutinib, zilucoplan and nebulised heparin with others to be added over time. 
      Bemcentinib could potentially reduce viral infection and blocks SARS-CoV-2 spike 
      protein; MEDI3506 is a clinic-ready anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibody with the 
      potential to treat respiratory failure caused by COVID; acalabrutinib is a BTK 
      inhibitor which is anti-viral and anti-inflammatory; zilucoplan is a complement C5 
      inhibitor which may block the severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 and; 
      nebulised heparin has been shown to bind with the spike protein. ACCORD is linked 
      with the UK national COVID therapeutics task force to help prioritise candidate 
      agents. MAIN OUTCOMES: Time to sustained clinical improvement of at least 2 points 
      (from randomisation) on the WHO 9-point category ordinal scale, live discharge from 
      the hospital, or considered fit for discharge (a score of 0, 1, or 2 on the ordinal 
      scale), whichever comes first, by Day 29 (this will also define the "responder" for 
      the response rate analyses). RANDOMISATION: An electronic randomization will be 
      performed by Cenduit using Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomisation will 
      be stratified by baseline severity grade. Randomisation will proceed with an equal 
      allocation to each arm and a contemporaneous SoC arm (e.g. 1:1 if control and 1 
      experimental arm; 1:1:1 if two experimental candidate arms etc) but will be reviewed 
      as the trial progresses and may be changed to 2:1 in favour of the candidate agents. 
      BLINDING (MASKING): The trial is open label and no blinding is currently planned in 
      the study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): This will be in the order of 60 
      patients per candidate agent for Stage 1, and 126 patients for Stage 2. However, 
      sample size re-estimation may be considered after Stage 1. It is estimated that up 
      to 1800 patients will participate in the overall study. TRIAL STATUS: Master 
      protocol version ACCORD-2-001 - Master Protocol (Amendment 1) 22(nd) April 2020, the 
      trial has full regulatory approval and recruitment is ongoing in the bemcentinib 
      (first patient recruited 6/5/2020), MEDI3506 (first patient recruited 19/5/2020), 
      acalabrutinib (first patient recruited 20/5/2020) and zilucoplan (first patient 
      recruited 19/5/2020) candidates (and SoC). The recruitment dates of each arm will 
      vary between candidate agents as they are added or dropped from the trial, but will 
      have recruited and reported within a year. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 
      2020-001736-95 , registered 28(th) April 2020. FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol 
      (Master Protocol with each of the candidate sub-protocols) is attached as an 
      additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the 
      interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has 
      been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full

AB  - Hydroxychloroquine has been touted as a potential COVID-19 treatment. Tocilizumab, 
      an inhibitor of IL-6, has also been proposed as a treatment of critically ill 
      patients. In this retrospective observational cohort study drawn from electronic 
      health records we sought to describe the association between mortality and 
      hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 
      Patients were hospitalized at a 13-hospital network spanning New Jersey USA between 
      March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for 
      SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Among 2512 hospitalized patients with 
      COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22%), 1539 (61%) discharges and 426 (17%) 
      remain hospitalized. 1914 (76%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 
      1473 (59%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for 
      imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were 
      no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any 
      hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.80-1.22]), 
      hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with 
      azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for 
      patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or 
      neither drug was 25%, 20%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU 
      patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis 
      found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment 
      (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and 
      without tocilizumab of 46% versus 56%. This observational cohort study suggests 
      hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not 
      associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab 
      demonstrated a trend association towards reduced mortality among ICU patients. Our 
      findings are limited to hospitalized patients and must be interpreted with caution 
      while awaiting results of randomized trials. Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov 
      Identifier: NCT04347993.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some COVID-19 cases test positive again for SARS-CoV-2 RNA following 
      negative test results and discharge, raising questions about the meaning of virus 
      detection. Better characterization of re-positive cases is urgently needed. METHODS: 
      Clinical data were obtained through Guangdong's COVID-19 surveillance network. 
      Neutralization antibody titre was determined using microneutralization assays. 
      Potential infectivity of clinical samples was evaluated by cell inoculation. 
      SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using three different RT-PCR kits and multiplex PCR with 
      nanopore sequencing. FINDINGS: Among 619 discharged COVID-19 cases, 87 re-tested as 
      SARS-CoV-2 positive in circumstances of social isolation. All re-positive cases had 
      mild or moderate symptoms at initial diagnosis and were younger on average (median, 
      28). Re-positive cases (n = 59) exhibited similar neutralization antibodies (NAbs) 
      titre distributions to other COVID-19 cases (n = 218) tested here. No infectious 
      strain could be obtained by culture and no full-length viral genomes could be 
      sequenced from re-positive cases. INTERPRETATION: Re-positive SARS-CoV-2 cases do 
      not appear to be caused by active reinfection and were identified in ~14% of 
      discharged cases. A robust NAb response and potential virus genome degradation were 
      detected in almost all re-positive cases, suggesting a substantially lower 
      transmission risk, especially through respiratory routes.

AB  - The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic 
      pathogen that was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012. 
      Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of 
      MERS-CoV continue to occur. Between April 2012 and December 2019, 2499 
      laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 858 deaths (34·3% 
      mortality) were reported from 27 countries to WHO, the majority of which were 
      reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths). Large outbreaks of human-to-human 
      transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South 
      Korea in 2015. MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a 
      priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, 
      epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures. This Seminar provides an update 
      on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of 
      transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection 
      control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered 
      questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.

AB  - Though recent reports link SARS-CoV-2 infections with hyper-inflammatory states in 
      children, most children experience no/mild symptoms, and hospitalization and 
      mortality rates are low in the age group. As symptoms are usually mild and 
      seroconversion occurs at low frequencies, it remains unclear whether children 
      significantly contribute to community transmission. Several hypotheses try to 
      explain age-related differences in disease presentation and severity. Possible 
      reasons for milder presentations in children as compared to adults include frequent 
      contact to seasonal coronaviruses, presence of cross-reactive antibodies, and/or 
      co-clearance with other viruses. Increased expression of ACE2 in young people may 
      facilitate virus infection, while limiting inflammation and reducing the risk of 
      severe disease. Further potential factors include recent vaccinations and a more 
      diverse memory T cell repertoire. This manuscript reviews age-related host factors 
      that may protect children from COVID-19 and complications associated, and addresses 
      the confusion around seropositivity and immunity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterise the clinical features of children and young people 
      admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK and explore factors associated with 
      admission to critical care, mortality, and development of multisystem inflammatory 
      syndrome in children and adolescents temporarily related to coronavirus disease 2019 
      (covid-19) (MIS-C). DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data 
      gathering and near real time analysis. SETTING: 260 hospitals in England, Wales, and 
      Scotland between 17 January and 3 July 2020, with a minimum follow-up time of two 
      weeks (to 17 July 2020). PARTICIPANTS: 651 children and young people aged less than 
      19 years admitted to 138 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute 
      Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical 
      Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), 
      in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C. 
      RESULTS: Median age was 4.6 (interquartile range 0.3-13.7) years, 35% (225/651) were 
      under 12 months old, and 56% (367/650) were male. 57% (330/576) were white, 12% 
      (67/576) South Asian, and 10% (56/576) black. 42% (276/651) had at least one 
      recorded comorbidity. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric cluster of symptoms was 
      identified, which encompassed the symptoms for the WHO MIS-C criteria. 18% (116/632) 
      of children were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis, this was 
      associated with age under 1 month (odds ratio 3.21, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 
      7.66; P=0.008), age 10-14 years (3.23, 1.55 to 6.99; P=0.002), and black ethnicity 
      (2.82, 1.41 to 5.57; P=0.003). Six (1%) of 627 patients died in hospital, all of 
      whom had profound comorbidity. 11% (52/456) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the 
      first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Children meeting MIS-C criteria were 
      older (median age 10.7 (8.3-14.1) v 1.6 (0.2-12.9) years; P<0.001) and more likely 
      to be of non-white ethnicity (64% (29/45) v 42% (148/355); P=0.004). Children with 
      MIS-C were five times more likely to be admitted to critical care (73% (38/52) v 15% 
      (62/404); P<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more 
      likely to present with fatigue (51% (24/47) v 28% (86/302); P=0.004), headache (34% 
      (16/47) v 10% (26/263); P<0.001), myalgia (34% (15/44) v 8% (21/270); P<0.001), sore 
      throat (30% (14/47) v (12% (34/284); P=0.003), and lymphadenopathy (20% (9/46) v 3% 
      (10/318); P<0.001) and to have a platelet count of less than 150 × 10(9)/L (32% 
      (16/50) v 11% (38/348); P<0.001) than children who did not have MIS-C. No deaths 
      occurred in the MIS-C group. CONCLUSIONS: Children and young people have less severe 
      acute covid-19 than adults. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric symptom cluster was 
      also identified in acute cases that shares features with MIS-C. This study provides 
      additional evidence for refining the WHO MIS-C preliminary case definition. Children 
      meeting the MIS-C criteria have different demographic and clinical features 
      depending on whether they have acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction 
      positive) or are post-acute (antibody positive). STUDY REGISTRATION: ISRCTN66726260.

TI  - Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome: Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 
      (PIMS-TS): Cardiac Features, Management and Short-Term Outcomes at a UK Tertiary 
      Paediatric Hospital.
PG  - 1391-1401
LID - 10.1007/s00246-020-02391-2 [doi]
AB  - Children were relatively spared during COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recently 
      reported hyperinflammatory syndrome with overlapping features of Kawasaki disease 
      and toxic shock syndrome-"Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome-temporally 
      associated with SARS-CoV-2" (PIMS-TS) has caused concern. We describe cardiac 
      findings and short-term outcomes in children with PIMS-TS at a tertiary children's 
      hospital. Single-center observational study of children with PIMS-TS from 10th April 
      to 9th May 2020. Data on ECG and echocardiogram were retrospectively analyzed along 
      with demographics, clinical features and blood parameters. Fifteen children with 
      median age of 8.8 (IQR 6.4-11.2) years were included, all were from 
      African/Afro-Caribbean, South Asian, Mixed or other minority ethnic groups. All 
      showed raised inflammatory/cardiac markers (CRP, ferritin, Troponin I, CK and 
      pro-BNP). Transient valve regurgitation was present in 10 patients (67%). Left 
      Ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in 12 (80%), fractional shortening in 8 
      (53%) with resolution in all but 2. Fourteen (93%) had coronary artery 
      abnormalities, with normalization in 6. ECG abnormalities were present in 9 (60%) 
      which normalized in 6 by discharge. Ten (67%) needed inotropes and/or vasopressors. 
      None needed extracorporeal life support. Improvement in cardiac biochemical markers 
      was closely followed by improvement in ECG/echocardiogram. All patients were 
      discharged alive and twelve (80%) have been reviewed since. Our entire cohort with 
      PIMS-TS had cardiac involvement and this degree of involvement is significantly more 
      than other published series and emphasizes the need for specialist cardiac review. 
      We believe that our multi-disciplinary team approach was crucial for the good 
      short-term outcomes.

AB  - There is a global concern of increasing number of children presenting with 
      inflammatory syndrome with clinical features simulating Kawasaki disease, during 
      ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The authors report a very similar case of 5-y-old boy 
      from a COVID-19 hotspot area who presented in late April 2020 with acute febrile 
      illness with abdominal pain and loose stools followed by shock. On examination, 
      child had bulbar conjunctivitis and extremity edema. Initial investigations showed 
      high inflammatory parameters, elevated serum creatinine and liver enzymes. 
      Echocardiography showed moderate LV dysfunction and normal coronaries. Cardiac 
      enzymes were also elevated, suggesting myocarditis. He was treated with inotropic 
      support, respiratory support with high flow nasal cannula, IV immunoglobulins, 
      aspirin, steroids and diuretics. RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative twice. His 
      clinical condition improved rapidly, was afebrile from day 2, inflammatory 
      parameters decreased, left ventricular function improved and was discharged after 6 
      d of hospital stay.

AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause 
      of a rapidly spreading illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting more 
      than seventeen million people around the world. Diagnosis and treatment guidelines 
      for clinicians caring for patients are needed. In the early stage, we have issued "A 
      rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus 
      (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)"; now there are many direct 
      evidences emerged and may change some of previous recommendations and it is ripe for 
      develop an evidence-based guideline. We formed a working group of clinical experts 
      and methodologists. The steering group members proposed 29 questions that are 
      relevant to the management of COVID-19 covering the following areas: 
      chemoprophylaxis, diagnosis, treatments, and discharge management. We searched the 
      literature for direct evidence on the management of COVID-19, and assessed its 
      certainty generated recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, 
      Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were either 
      strong or weak, or in the form of ungraded consensus-based statement. Finally, we 
      issued 34 statements. Among them, 6 were strong recommendations for, 14 were weak 
      recommendations for, 3 were weak recommendations against and 11 were ungraded 
      consensus-based statement. They covered topics of chemoprophylaxis (including agents 
      and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) agents), diagnosis (including clinical 
      manifestations, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 
      respiratory tract specimens, IgM and IgG antibody tests, chest computed tomography, 
      chest x-ray, and CT features of asymptomatic infections), treatments (including 
      lopinavir-ritonavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, interferon, remdesivir, combination of 
      antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, interleukin-6 inhibitors, 
      interleukin-1 inhibitors, glucocorticoid, qingfei paidu decoction, lianhua qingwen 
      granules/capsules, convalescent plasma, lung transplantation, invasive or 
      noninvasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and 
      discharge management (including discharge criteria and management plan in patients 
      whose RT-PCR retesting shows SARS-CoV-2 positive after discharge). We also created 
      two figures of these recommendations for the implementation purpose. We hope these 
      recommendations can help support healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      vaccines and therapeutics will depend on understanding viral immunity. We studied T 
      cell memory in 42 patients following recovery from COVID-19 (28 with mild disease 
      and 14 with severe disease) and 16 unexposed donors, using interferon-γ-based assays 
      with peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 except ORF1. The breadth and magnitude of T cell 
      responses were significantly higher in severe as compared with mild cases. Total and 
      spike-specific T cell responses correlated with spike-specific antibody responses. 
      We identified 41 peptides containing CD4(+) and/or CD8(+) epitopes, including six 
      immunodominant regions. Six optimized CD8(+) epitopes were defined, with peptide-MHC 
      pentamer-positive cells displaying the central and effector memory phenotype. In 
      mild cases, higher proportions of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) T cells were observed. 
      The identification of T cell responses associated with milder disease will support 
      an understanding of protective immunity and highlights the potential of including 
      non-spike proteins within future COVID-19 vaccine design.

AB  - The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic 
      has caused a public health crisis that is exacerbated by our poor understanding of 
      correlates of immunity. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19), with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic carriage to life 
      threatening pneumonia and cytokine dysregulation [1-3]. Although antibodies have 
      been shown in a variety of in vitro assays to promote coronavirus infections through 
      mechanisms requiring interactions between IgG antibodies and Fc gamma receptors 
      (FcγRs), the relevance of these observations to coronavirus infections in humans is 
      not known [4-7]. In light of ongoing clinical trials examining convalescent serum 
      therapy for COVID-19 patients and expedited SARS-CoV-2 vaccine testing in humans, it 
      is essential to clarify the role of antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here 
      we show that adults with PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 produce IgG antibodies with a 
      specific Fc domain repertoire that is characterized by reduced fucosylation, a 
      modification that enhances interactions with the activating FcγR, FcγRIIIa. Fc 
      fucosylation was reduced when compared with SARS-CoV-2-seropositive children and 
      relative to adults with symptomatic influenza virus infections. These results 
      demonstrate an antibody correlate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults and 
      have implications for novel therapeutic strategies targeting FcγRIIIa pathways.

AB  - AIMS: The immune response is essential for the control and resolution of viral 
      infections. Following the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several 
      immunotherapies were applied to modulate the immune responses of the affected 
      patients. In this review, we aimed to describe the role of the immune system in 
      response to COVID-19. We also provide a systematic review to collate and describe 
      all published reports of the using immunotherapies, including convalescent plasma 
      therapy, monoclonal antibodies, cytokine therapy, mesenchymal stem cell therapy, and 
      intravenous immunoglobulin and their important outcomes in COVID-19 patients. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A thorough search strategy was applied to identify published 
      research trials in PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and EMBASE from Dec 1, 2019, to May 4, 
      2020, for studies reporting clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with 
      immunotherapies along with other standard cares. KEY FINDINGS: From an initial 
      screen of 80 identified studies, 24 studies provided clinical outcome data on the 
      use of immunotherapies for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, including 
      convalescent plasma therapy (33 patients), monoclonal antibodies (55 patients), 
      interferon (31 patients), mesenchymal stem cell therapy (8 patient), and 
      immunoglobulin (63 patients). Except for nine severe patients who died after 
      treatment, most patients were recovered from COVID-19 with improved clinical 
      symptoms and laboratory assessment. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the available evidence, 
      it seems that treatment with immunotherapy along with other standard cares could be 
      an effective and safe approach to modulate the immune system and improvement of 
      clinical outcomes.

AB  - Since December 2019, numerous cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by 
      the infection of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been confirmed in Wuhan, 
      China. The outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China embodied a significant and urgent threat 
      to global health. 2019-nCoV was a new, highly contagious coronavirus discovered 
      following the outbreak of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV). The novel coronavirus can cause severe respiratory disease and even 
      death. However, no specific therapeutic drugs have been developed clinically thus 
      far. This article examines the potential of therapeutic drugs by assessing the 
      structure of 2019-nCoV, its mechanism in invading host cells, and the anti-viral 
      mechanism of the human autoimmune system. We also review the latest research 
      regarding the progress of potential therapeutic drugs and provide references for new 
      drug developments of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: School closures have occurred globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      However, empiric data on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among children and in educational settings are scarce. In 
      Australia, most schools have remained open during the first epidemic wave, albeit 
      with reduced student physical attendance at the epidemic peak. We examined 
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children and staff in schools and early childhood 
      education and care (ECEC) settings in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). 
      METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed paediatric (aged ≤18 years) and adult COVID-19 cases 
      who attended a school or ECEC setting while considered infectious (defined as 24 h 
      before symptom onset based on national guidelines during the study period) in NSW 
      from Jan 25 to April 10, 2020, were investigated for onward transmission. All 
      identified school and ECEC settings close contacts were required to home quarantine 
      for 14 days, and were monitored and offered SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing if 
      symptomatic. Enhanced investigations in selected educational settings included 
      nucleic acid testing and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic 
      contacts. Secondary attack rates were calculated and compared with state-wide 
      COVID-19 rates. FINDINGS: 15 schools and ten ECEC settings had children (n=12) or 
      adults (n=15) attend while infectious, with 1448 contacts monitored. Of these, 633 
      (43·7%) of 1448 had nucleic acid testing, or antibody testing, or both, with 18 
      secondary cases identified (attack rate 1·2%). Five secondary cases (three children; 
      two adults) were identified (attack rate 0·5%; 5/914) in three schools. No secondary 
      transmission occurred in nine of ten ECEC settings among 497 contacts. However, one 
      outbreak in an ECEC setting involved transmission to six adults and seven children 
      (attack rate 35·1%; 13/37). Across all settings, five (28·0%) of 18 secondary 
      infections were asymptomatic (three infants [all aged 1 year], one adolescent [age 
      15 years], and one adult). INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates were low in 
      NSW educational settings during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave, consistent with 
      mild infrequent disease in the 1·8 million child population. With effective 
      case-contact testing and epidemic management strategies and associated small numbers 
      of attendances while infected, children and teachers did not contribute 
      significantly to COVID-19 transmission via attendance in educational settings. These 
      findings could be used to inform modelling and public health policy regarding school 
      closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. FUNDING: NSW Government Department of Health.

AB  - Objective: To explore the feasibility of direct renin inhibitor aliskiren for the 
      treatment of severe patients of COVID-19 with hypertension. Methods: A retrospective 
      case analysis of effectiveness and safety of aliskiren treatment to lower blood 
      pressure in three severe and one critically ill patients of COVID-19 with 
      hypertension. Results: Four patients, two males and two females, with an average age 
      of 78 years (66-87 years), were referred to hospital mainly because of respiratory 
      symptoms. Three cases were confirmed by 2019-nCoV nucleic acid and antibody 
      detection (severe type), and one with cardiac insufficiency was clinically 
      determined (critically ill type). The previous diagnosis of hypertension was clear. 
      Two patients took calcium channel antagonist (CCB), one patient took angiotensin 
      converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and one patient took angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist (ARB). After admission, ACEI or ARB were discontinued, one patient with 
      heart failure patient was treated by aliskiren combined with diuretic; 3 patients 
      were treated with aliskiren combined with CCB. Two patients were stopped to use CCB 
      due to low blood pressure after 1 to 2 weeks of using CCB and aliskiren. On the 
      basis of comprehensive therapy combined with antiviral and oxygenation treatment, 
      aliskiren antihypertensive treatment was taken for three to four weeks. The blood 
      pressure control of four patients was satisfactory and there was no complaint of 
      discomfort. The condition improved, and all patients had reached the discharge 
      standard and were discharged. Conclusion: Our preliminary clinical data shows that 
      aliskiren's antihypertensive therapy is effective and safe for severe COVID-19 
      patients complicated with hypertension. Further clinical aliskiren therapy study is 
      required with more COVID-19 patients..

TI  - Analysis of a SARS-CoV-2-Infected Individual Reveals Development of Potent

AB  - Antibody responses develop following SARS-CoV-2 infection, but little is known about 
      their epitope specificities, clonality, binding affinities, epitopes, and 
      neutralizing activity. We isolated B cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 envelope 
      glycoprotein spike (S) from a COVID-19-infected subject 21 days after the onset of 
      clinical disease. 45 S-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated. They had 
      undergone minimal somatic mutation with limited clonal expansion, and three bound 
      the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Two antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2. The most 
      potent antibody bound the RBD and prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the 
      other bound outside the RBD. Thus, most anti-S antibodies that were generated in 
      this patient during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection were non-neutralizing and 
      target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 
      interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive 
      maturation. Such antibodies have potential preventive and/or therapeutic potential 
      and can serve as templates for vaccine design.

TI  - A Case of Critically Ill Infant of Coronavirus Disease 2019 With Persistent 
      Reduction of T Lymphocytes.
PG  - e87-e90
LID - 10.1097/INF.0000000000002720 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming a global 
      threat. However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of 
      critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus 
      that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases 
      of COVID-19 have been reported. METHODS: Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, 
      treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically 
      ill infant were recorded. RESULTS: The infant had life-threatening clinical features 
      including high fever, septic shock, recurrent apnea, petechiae and acute kidney 
      injury and persistent declined CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The duration of 
      nasopharyngeal virus shedding lasted for 49 days even with the administration of 
      lopinavir/ritonavir for 8 days. The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was partially 
      recovered 68 days post onset of the disease. Accumulating of effector memory CD4+ T 
      cells (CD4+TEM) was observed among T-cell compartment. The nucleic acid tests and 
      serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the 
      infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no 
      strict personal protection. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T 
      cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19. CD4+ and CD8+ 
      T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical 
      course in children. The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the 
      severity of respiratory injury. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infant (even 
      very critical cases) to adult might be unlikely.

AB  - Concerns regarding the comorbidity as a significant risk factor for Coronavirus 
      Disease-2019 (COVID-19), gave rise to an urgent need for studies evaluating patients 
      with chronic conditions such as autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs). We prepared a 
      web-based survey investigating the clinical findings and contact histories among 
      pediatric patients with AIDs. Confirmed COVID-19 cases, patients with contact 
      history and those with symptoms which were highly suggestive of COVID-19 were called 
      via phone or recruited to a video or face to face appointment. Data of AIDs were 
      obtained from their medical records, retrospectively. Laboratory and screening 
      findings were confirmed by our national health registry website. There were 404 
      patients (217 female) eligible for the enrollment. During pandemic, 375 (93%) were 
      on colchicine treatment and 48 (11.8%) were receiving biologic treatment. 
      Twenty-four out of 404 patients were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 suspicion. 
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) was identified through 
      rhinopharyngeal swabs in seven patients, six of whom were only on colchicine 
      treatment. Only one patient with no finding of any severe respiratory complications 
      was hospitalized. All of seven patients recovered completely. Among patients on 
      biologic drugs, neither a symptom nor a positive polymerase chain reaction test for 
      COVID 19 was detected. In conclusion, pediatric patients with AIDs, those receiving 
      biologic treatment and/or colchicine, may not be at increased risk for neither being 
      infected nor the severe disease course.

AB  - Recently, the recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in recovered COVID-19 
      patients is receiving more attention. Herein we report a cohort study on the 
      follow-up of 182 recovered patients under medical isolation observation. Twenty 
      (10.99%) patients out of the 182 were detected to be SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive 
      (re-positives), although none showed any clinical symptomatic recurrence, indicating 
      that COVID-19 responds well to treatment. Patients aged under 18 years had higher 
      re-positive rates than average, and none of the severely ill patients re-tested 
      positive. There were no significant differences in sex between re-positives and 
      non-re-positives. Notably, most of the re-positives turned negative in the following 
      tests, and all of them carried antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This indicates that 
      they might not be infectious, although it is still important to perform regular 
      SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing and follow-up for assessment of infectivity. The findings of 
      this study provide information for improving the management of recovered patients, 
      and for differentiating the follow-up of recovered patients with different risk 
      levels.

      immunoassays.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) was approved by the 
      FDA for use in severe cases of COVID-19 under an emergency Investigational New Drug 
      (IND) protocol. Eligibility criteria for CCP donors includes documentation of 
      evidence of COVID-19 either by viral RNA detection at the time of illness or 
      positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG after recovery if diagnostic testing for COVID-19 was not 
      performed at the time of illness. In addition to analysis of CCP, analysis of 
      SARS-CoV-2 IgG provides information for possible past exposure and may support 
      diagnosis when SARS-CoV-2 PCR is negative and clinical suspicion for COVID-19 is 
      high. Furthermore, assays with high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG 
      are critical for understanding community exposure rates to SARS-CoV-2. Currently, 
      there are several assays that test for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a variety of 
      methods, including point-of-care lateral flow-based devices, high throughput 
      immunoassay analyzers, and manual methods such as ELISA. These assays target a 
      number of SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the nucleocapsid protein (N), full length 
      spike protein (S), S1 subunit, or receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. 
      Given the heterogeneity among methods for, and antigenic targets used in SARS-CoV-2 
      antibody assays, it is necessary for careful evaluation of these assays prior to 
      implementation for clinical use. We compared two assays that had received the CE 
      mark of regulatory approval and that used either the N antigen or S1-RBD antigen as 
      the target for analysis of a large set of CCP samples. Our data indicates that 
      sensitivity and specificity vary between these assays and that more than one 
      antigenic target may be required to improve the sensitivity and specificity of IgG 
      detection to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Children and youth infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) have milder disease than do adults, and even among those with the 
      recently described multisystem inflammatory syndrome, mortality is rare. The reasons 
      for the differences in clinical manifestations are unknown but suggest that 
      age-dependent factors may modulate the antiviral immune response. We compared 
      cytokine, humoral, and cellular immune responses in pediatric (children and youth, 
      age <24 years) (n = 65) and adult (n = 60) patients with coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) at a metropolitan hospital system in New York City. The pediatric 
      patients had a shorter length of stay, decreased requirement for mechanical 
      ventilation, and lower mortality compared to adults. The serum concentrations of 
      interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), but not tumor necrosis factor-α 
      (TNF-α) or IL-6, were inversely related to age. Adults mounted a more robust T cell 
      response to the viral spike protein compared to pediatric patients as evidenced by 
      increased expression of CD25(+) on CD4(+) T cells and the frequency of IFN-γ(+) 
      CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, serum neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent 
      cellular phagocytosis were higher in adults compared to pediatric patients with 
      COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody titer correlated positively with age and 
      negatively with IL-17A and IFN-γ serum concentrations. There were no differences in 
      anti-spike protein antibody titers to other human coronaviruses. Together, these 
      findings demonstrate that the poor outcome in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 
      compared to children may not be attributable to a failure to generate adaptive 
      immune responses.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the outcomes of pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed 
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with or without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in 
      children (MIS-C). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 471 samples collected 
      from 371 patients (age<18 years) suspected of having severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The study group comprised 66/371 
      (18%) laboratory-confirmed pediatric COVID-19 patients: 61 (92.5%) patients tested 
      positive on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests for 
      SARS-CoV-2, and 5 (7.5%) patients tested positive on serological tests. MIS-C was 
      diagnosed according to the criteria of the Center for Disease Control. RESULTS: 
      MIS-C was diagnosed in 6/66 (9%) patients. The frequencies of diarrhea, vomiting, 
      and/or abdominal pain (67% vs. 22%, p=0.034); pediatric SARS (67% vs. 13%, p=0.008); 
      hypoxemia (83% vs. 23%, p=0.006); and arterial hypotension (50% vs. 3%, p=0.004) 
      were significantly higher in patients with MIS-C than in those without MIS-C. The 
      frequencies of C-reactive protein levels >50 mg/L (83% vs. 25%, p=0.008) and D-dimer 
      levels >1000 ng/mL (100% vs. 40%, p=0.007) and the median D-dimer, troponin T, and 
      ferritin levels (p<0.05) were significantly higher in patients with MIS-C. The 
      frequencies of pediatric intensive care unit admission (100% vs. 60%, p=0.003), 
      mechanical ventilation (83% vs. 7%, p<0.001), vasoactive agent use (83% vs. 3%, 
      p<0.001), shock (83% vs. 5%, p<0.001), cardiac abnormalities (100% vs. 2%, p<0.001), 
      and death (67% vs. 3%, p<0.001) were also significantly higher in patients with 
      MIS-C. Similarly, the frequencies of oxygen therapy (100% vs. 33%, p=0.003), 
      intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (67% vs. 2%, p<0.001), aspirin therapy (50% vs. 
      0%, p<0.001), and current acute renal replacement therapy (50% vs. 2%, p=0.002) were 
      also significantly higher in patients with MIS-C. Logistic regression analysis 
      showed that the presence of MIS-C was significantly associated with gastrointestinal 
      manifestations [odds ratio (OR)=10.98; 95%CI (95% confidence interval)=1.20-100.86; 
      p=0.034] and hypoxemia [OR=16.85; 95%CI=1.34-211.80; p=0.029]. Further univariate 
      analysis showed a positive association between MIS-C and death [OR=58.00; 
      95%CI=6.39-526.79; p<0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with 
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with MIS-C had a severe clinical spectrum with a high 
      mortality rate. Our study emphasizes the importance of investigating MIS-C in 
      pediatric patients with COVID-19 presenting with gastrointestinal involvement and 
      hypoxemia.

AB  - World is living on the edge. The human cost of COVID pandemic could be 
      extraordinary. We find ourselves in a time of great economic, social, and medical 
      uncertainty. The pandemic demands action on many fronts, from prevention to testing 
      to treatment. We need to create simple, cheap, more accessible testing for 
      SARS-CoV-2. A faster way has to be developed to identify antibodies that neutralize 
      the virus. More than 100 vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 are at various stages of 
      development. Some six groups have already begun injecting formulations into 
      volunteers in safety trials; others have started testing in animals. The biggest 
      challenge is to determine which vaccine is ideal. Reason and science have to guide 
      us. There is urgent need to critically appraise evidence in deciding how to treat 
      patients. We need a drug or combination of drugs that work. Remdesivir has generated 
      hope. It may prove to be a magic bullet. Countries like Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, 
      Hong Kong, South Korea, New Zealand have done exceptionally well to contain the 
      spread of COVID-19. It is widely believed that during the pandemic treatment 
      suffers. Patients with diseases like cancer, diabetes, renal failure, CAD and 
      pregnant women need special attention. As the pandemic pushes up levels of hunger 
      among the global poor, governments must prevent devastating nutrition and health 
      consequences for children missing out on school meals amid school closures. Nations 
      will have endemic SARS-CoV-2 infection for the foreseeable future. A structured and 
      well-coordinated approach is critical for tackling this global crisis.

AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a worldwide pandemic. 
      The severe morbidity and mortality associated with coronavirus disease 2019 has 
      mostly affected the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions. We present 
      a case of a 12-year-old girl with no past medical history who presented with fever, 
      cough, and vomiting. Laboratory evaluation revealed severe thrombocytopenia and 
      elevated markers of inflammation. The patient progressed to respiratory failure, and 
      testing results for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 returned 
      positive. Because of the severity of her thrombocytopenia, she was treated with 
      intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids with prompt improvement in platelets. The 
      patient's severe acute respiratory distress syndrome was managed with mechanical 
      ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, and then airway pressure release ventilation. 
      After azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine were given without improvement, our 
      patient received tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, and 
      remdesivir, a broad antiviral agent, with significant clinical benefit soon 
      afterward. Given that severe pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 is rare, we hope to 
      inform pediatric providers on the clinical course and management considerations as 
      this pandemic continues to spread.

      recovering good practices.].
LID - e202007083 [pii]
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a major impact on birth care and lactation. The lack 
      of knowledge regarding the transmission mechanisms and the potential risks for the 
      mother and the newborn, even when the vertical transmission of the virus has not 
      been demonstrated, has led to the abandonment of practices such as skin-to-skin and 
      the early initiation of breastfeeding (BF), which offer great benefits for maternal 
      and child health. Taking into account the available scientific evidence and the 
      protective effect of BF, the World Health Organization (WHO), and other organisms 
      recommend, in cases of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection of the mother, 
      maintaining mother-child contact and BF, adopting preventive measure procedures to 
      minimize the risk of contagion. These measures include hand hygiene, before and 
      after contact with the newborn and the use of a mask. If a temporary separation of 
      mother and child is required, it is recommended to feed the newborn with expressed 
      breast milk. The presence of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in 
      the milk of infected women, so BF could reduce the clinical impact of the disease in 
      the infant, if it becomes infected.

AB  - As the COVID-19 is still growing throughout the globe, a thorough investigation into 
      the specific immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2, its interaction with the host immune 
      system and pathogen evasion mechanism may provide a clear picture of how the 
      pathogen can breach the host immune defenses in elderly patients and patients with 
      comorbid conditions. Such studies will also reveal the underlying mechanism of how 
      children and young patients can withstand the disease better. The study of the 
      immune defense mechanisms and the prolonged immune memory from patients population 
      with convalescent plasma may help in designing a suitable vaccine candidate not only 
      for the current outbreak but also for similar outbreaks in the future. The vital 
      drug candidates, which are being tested as potential vaccines or therapeutics 
      against COVID-19, include live attenuated vaccine, inactivated or killed vaccine, 
      subunit vaccine, antibodies, interferon treatment, repurposing existing drugs, and 
      nucleic acid-based vaccines. Several organizations around the world have 
      fast-tracked the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, and some drugs already went to 
      phase III of clinical trials. Hence, here, we have tried to take a quick glimpse of 
      the development stages of vaccines or therapeutic approaches to treat this deadly 
      disease.

      Systematic Review.
PG  - 1055-1060
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1712161 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to summarize currently available evidence on 
      vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2). STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted following the 
      guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis 
      Statement. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies comprising 83 neonates born to mothers 
      diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 were included in the present systematic 
      review. Among these neonates, three were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 16, 
      36, and 72 hours after birth, respectively, by nasopharyngeal swab real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests; another six had elevated virus-specific 
      antibody levels in serum samples collected after birth, but negative RT-PCR test 
      results. However, without positive RT-PCR tests of amniotic fluid, placenta, or cord 
      blood, there is a lack of virologic evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission. 
      CONCLUSION: There is currently no direct evidence to support intrauterine vertical 
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Additional RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and 
      cord blood are needed to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine vertical 
      transmission. For pregnant women infected during their first and second trimesters, 
      further studies focusing on long-term outcomes are needed. KEY POINTS: · We review 
      neonates of mothers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 detected by RT-PCR.. · 
      No direct virologic evidence of vertical transmission has been reported.. · No 
      evidence that cesarean delivery is safer than vaginal delivery.. · More RT-PCR tests 
      on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are recommended..

TI  - Age and Location in Severity of COVID-19 Pathology: Do Lactoferrin and Pneumococcal 
      Vaccination Explain Low Infant Mortality and Regional Differences?
PG  - e2000076
LID - 10.1002/bies.202000076 [doi]
AB  - Two conundrums puzzle COVID-19 investigators: 1) morbidity and mortality is rare 
      among infants and young children and 2) rates of morbidity and mortality exhibit 
      large variances across nations, locales, and even within cities. It is found that 
      the higher the rate of pneumococcal vaccination in a nation (or city) the lower the 
      COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Vaccination rates with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, 
      poliovirus, and other vaccines do not correlate with COVID-19 risks, nor do COVID-19 
      case or death rates correlate with number of people in the population with diabetes, 
      obesity, or adults over 65. Infant protection may be due to maternal antibodies and 
      antiviral proteins in milk such as lactoferrin that are known to protect against 
      coronavirus infections. Subsequent protection might then be conferred (and correlate 
      with) rates of Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) (universal in infants) and 
      pneumococcal vaccination, the latter varying widely by geography among infants, 
      at-risk adults, and the elderly. Also see the video abstract here

PG  - 601-609
LID - 10.1007/s40291-020-00486-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Without a specific antiviral treatment or vaccine, severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, 
      affecting over 200 countries worldwide. A better understanding of B- and T-cell 
      immunity is critical to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A cohort of 129 patients with COVID-19 and 20 
      suspected cases were enrolled in this study, and a lateral flow 
      immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) and a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme 
      immunoassay (MCLIA) were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG detection. Additionally, 
      127 patients with COVID-19 were selected for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies 
      to SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate B-cell immunity, and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets 
      were quantified in 95 patients with COVID-19 to evaluate T-cell immunity. RESULTS: 
      The sensitivity and specificity of LFIA-IgM/IgG and MCLIA-IgM/IgG assays for 
      detecting SARS-CoV infection were > 90%, comparable with reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction detection. IgM antibody levels peaked on day 13 and began 
      to fall on day 21, while IgG antibody levels peaked on day 17 and were maintained 
      until tracking ended. Lymphocyte and subset enumeration suggested that 
      lymphocytopenia occurred in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: LFIA-IgM/IgG and 
      MCLIA-IgM/IgG assays can indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection, which elicits an antibody 
      response. Lymphocytopenia occurs in patients with COVID-19, which possibly weakens 
      the T-cell response.

AB  - BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection commonly presents as fever, 
      cough, and shortness of breath in adults. Children are thought to have milder 
      respiratory symptoms and to recover more quickly. We describe a new presentation of 
      COVID-19 infection in children consisting of multisystem inflammation with decreased 
      left ventricular function and evidence of lung disease. CASE REPORT Three children 
      presented with fever, conjunctivitis, dry and cracked lips, rash, and/or cervical 
      lymphadenopathy for at least 5 days. Two of these children required mechanical 
      ventilation, and 1 of the 2 needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to 
      support cardiorespiratory function. All of these children had moderate to severe 
      hyponatremia and lymphopenia, which is usually seen in COVID-19. They were treated 
      with intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose aspirin. All of the children 
      recovered. CONCLUSIONS Early recognition of children with multisystem inflammation 
      is important because they are at increased risk for deterioration. Treatment with 
      intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin was used because this regimen has been shown 
      to be beneficial in vasculitis of Kawasaki disease. The development of shock due to 
      cardiac involvement may require ECMO.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment of patients 
      with allergic and atopy-associated diseases has faced major challenges. 
      Recommendations for "social distancing" and the fear of patients becoming infected 
      during a visit to a medical facility have led to a drastic decrease in personal 
      doctor-patient contacts. This affects both acute care and treatment of the 
      chronically ill. The immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection is so far only 
      insufficiently understood and could be altered in a favorable or unfavorable way by 
      therapy with monoclonal antibodies. There is currently no evidence for an increased 
      risk of a severe COVID-19 course in allergic patients. Many patients are under 
      ongoing therapy with biologicals that inhibit type 2 immune responses via various 
      mechanisms. There is uncertainty about possible immunological interactions and 
      potential risks of these biologicals in the case of an infection with SARS-CoV-2. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed, 
      Livivo, and the internet to cover the past 10 years (May 2010 - April 2020). 
      Additionally, the current German-language publications were analyzed. Based on these 
      data, the present position paper provides recommendations for the biological 
      treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In order to maintain in-office consultation services, a 
      safe treatment environment must be created that is adapted to the pandemic 
      situation. To date, there is a lack of reliable study data on the care for patients 
      with complex respiratory, atopic, and allergic diseases in times of an imminent 
      infection risk from SARS-CoV-2. Type-2-dominant immune reactions, as they are 
      frequently seen in allergic patients, could influence various phases of COVID-19, 
      e.g., by slowing down the immune reactions. Theoretically, this could have an 
      unfavorable effect in the early phase of a SARS-Cov-2 infection, but also a positive 
      effect during a cytokine storm in the later phase of severe courses. However, since 
      there is currently no evidence for this, all data from patients treated with a 
      biological directed against type 2 immune reactions who develop COVID-19 should be 
      collected in registries, and their disease courses documented in order to be able to 
      provide experience-based instructions in the future. CONCLUSION: The use of 
      biologicals for the treatment of bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic 
      rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and spontaneous urticaria should be continued as 
      usual in patients without suspected infection or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. If 
      available, it is recommended to prefer a formulation for self-application and to 
      offer telemedical monitoring. Treatment should aim at the best possible control of 
      difficult-to-control allergic and atopic diseases using adequate rescue and add-on 
      therapy and should avoid the need for systemic glucocorticosteroids. If SARS-CoV-2 
      infection is proven or reasonably suspected, the therapy should be determined by 
      weighing the benefits and risks individually for the patient in question, and the 
      patient should be involved in the decision-making. It should be kept in mind that 
      the potential effects of biologicals on the immune response in COVID-19 are 
      currently not known. Telemedical offers are particularly desirable for the acute 
      consultation needs of suitable patients.

      Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).

AB  - Initially, the global outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spared children from severe disease. However, 
      after the initial wave of infections, clusters of a novel hyperinflammatory disease 
      have been reported in regions with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. While the 
      characteristic clinical features are becoming clear, the pathophysiology remains 
      unknown. Herein, we report on the immune profiles of eight Multisystem Inflammatory 
      Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) cases. We document that all MIS-C patients had evidence 
      of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with normal 
      isotype-switching and neutralization capability. We further profiled the secreted 
      immune response by high-dimensional cytokine assays, which identified elevated 
      signatures of inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and 
      activation (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1) and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, 
      CCL28). Mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of 
      mDC1 and non-classical monocytes, as well as both NK- and T- lymphocytes, suggesting 
      extravasation to affected tissues. Markers of activated myeloid function were also 
      evident, including upregulation of ICAM1 and FcR1 in neutrophil and non-classical 
      monocytes, well-documented markers in autoinflammation and autoimmunity that 
      indicate enhanced antigen presentation and Fc-mediated responses. Finally, to assess 
      the role for autoimmunity secondary to infection, we profiled the auto-antigen 
      reactivity of MIS-C plasma, which revealed both known disease-associated 
      autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that recognize endothelial, 
      gastrointestinal and immune-cell antigens. All patients were treated with anti- IL6R 
      antibody or IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution tracking with normalization 
      of inflammatory markers.

AB  - Background: In COVID 19 related lung disease, which is a leading cause of death from 
      this disease, cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) may be pivotal 
      in the pathogenesis. TNF alpha reduces fluid absorption due to impairment of sodium 
      and chloride transport required for building an osmotic gradient across epithelial 
      cells, which in the airways maintains airway surface liquid helping to keep airways 
      open and enabling bacterial clearance and aids water absorption from the alveolar 
      spaces. TNF alpha can, through Rho-kinase, disintegrate the endothelial and 
      epithelial cytoskeleton, and thus break up intercellular tight junctional proteins, 
      breaching the intercellular barrier, which prevents flooding of the interstitial and 
      alveolar spaces with fluid. Hypotheses: (1) Preservation and restoration of airway 
      and alveolar epithelial sodium and chloride transport and the cytoskeleton dependent 
      integrity of the cell barriers within the lung can prevent and treat COVID 19 lung 
      disease. (2) TNF alpha is the key mediator of pulmonary edema in COVID 19 lung 
      disease. Confirmation of hypothesis and implications: The role of a reduction in the 
      function of epithelial sodium and chloride transport could with regards to chloride 
      transport be tested by analysis of chloride levels in exhaled breath condensate and 
      levels correlated with TNF alpha concentrations. Reduced levels would indicate a 
      reduction of the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
      (CFTR) chloride channel and a correlation with TNF alpha levels indicative of its 
      involvement. Anti-TNF alpha treatment with antibodies is already available and needs 
      to be tested in randomized controlled trials of COVID 19 lung disease. TNF alpha 
      levels could also be reduced by statins, aspirin, and curcumin. Chloride transport 
      could be facilitated by CFTR activators, including curcumin and phosphodiesterase-5 
      inhibitors. Sodium and chloride transport could be further regulated to prevent 
      accumulation of alveolar fluid by use of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter type 1 
      inhibitors, which have been associated with improved outcome in adults ventilated 
      for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in randomized controlled trials. 
      Primary prevention of coronavirus infection and TNF alpha release in response to it 
      could be improved by induction of antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and human beta 
      defensin-2 and reduction of TNF alpha production by vitamin D prophylaxis for the 
      population as a whole.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection has emerged as a serious global pandemic. Because of the high 
      transmissibility of the virus and the high rate of morbidity and mortality 
      associated with COVID-19, developing effective and safe vaccines is a top research 
      priority. Here, we provide a detailed evaluation of the immunogenicity of lipid 
      nanoparticle-encapsulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) vaccines encoding the 
      full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain in mice. 
      We demonstrate that a single dose of these vaccines induces strong type 1 CD4(+) and 
      CD8(+) T cell responses, as well as long-lived plasma and memory B cell responses. 
      Additionally, we detect robust and sustained neutralizing antibody responses and the 
      antibodies elicited by nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines do not show 
      antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in vitro. Our findings suggest that the 
      nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine platform can induce robust immune responses and 
      is a promising candidate to combat COVID-19.

AB  - Initially, children were thought to be spared from disease caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, a month into the epidemic, 
      a novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged. Herein, we 
      report on the immune profiles of nine MIS-C cases. All MIS-C patients had evidence 
      of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with intact 
      neutralization capability. Cytokine profiling identified elevated signatures of 
      inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and activation 
      (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1), and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, and 
      CCL28). Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of non-classical 
      monocytes, and subsets of NK and T lymphocytes, suggesting extravasation to affected 
      tissues. Finally, profiling the autoantigen reactivity of MIS-C plasma revealed both 
      known disease-associated autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that 
      recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal, and immune-cell antigens. All patients were 
      treated with anti-IL-6R antibody and/or IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution.

AB  - The current outbreak of viral pneumonia, caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is 
      the focus of worldwide attention. The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic 
      event on Mar 12, 2020, and the number of confirmed cases is still on the rise 
      worldwide. While most infected individuals only experience mild symptoms or may even 
      be asymptomatic, some patients rapidly progress to severe acute respiratory failure 
      with substantial mortality, making it imperative to develop an efficient treatment 
      for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia alongside supportive care. So far, the optimal 
      treatment strategy for severe COVID-19 remains unknown. Intravenous immunoglobulin 
      (IVIg) is a blood product pooled from healthy donors with high concentrations of 
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) and has been used in patients with autoimmune and 
      inflammatory diseases for more than 30 years. In this review, we aim to highlight 
      the known mechanisms of immunomodulatory effects of high-dose IVIg therapy, the 
      immunopathological hypothesis of viral pneumonia, and the clinical evidence of IVIg 
      therapy in viral pneumonia. We then make cautious therapeutic inferences about 
      high-dose IVIg therapy in treating severe COVID-19. These inferences may provide 
      relevant and useful insights in order to aid treatment for COVID-19.

AB  - Limited data are available for pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2. Serological 
      tests are critically important for determining SARS-CoV-2 exposures within both 
      individuals and populations. We validated a SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain 
      serological test using 834 pre-pandemic samples and 31 samples from COVID-19 
      recovered donors. We then completed SARS-CoV-2 serological testing of 1,293 
      parturient women at two centers in Philadelphia from April 4 to June 3, 2020. We 
      found 80/1,293 (6.2%) of parturient women possessed IgG and/or IgM 
      SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We found race/ethnicity differences in 
      seroprevalence rates, with higher rates in Black/non-Hispanic and Hispanic/Latino 
      women. Of the 72 seropositive women who also received nasopharyngeal polymerase 
      chain reaction testing during pregnancy, 46 (64%) were positive. Continued serologic 
      surveillance among pregnant women may inform perinatal clinical practices and can 
      potentially be used to estimate exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within the community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A healthy 25-year-old woman developed COVID-19 disease with clinical 
      characteristics resembling Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a 
      rare form of COVID-19 described primarily in children under 21 years of age. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: The patient presented with 1 week of weakness, dyspnea, and low-grade 
      fevers, followed by mild cough, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, and lymph node 
      swelling. She was otherwise healthy, with no prior medical history. Her hospital 
      course was notable for profound acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, hypotension, and 
      cardiac dysfunction requiring ICU admission and vasopressor support. MIS-C-like 
      illness secondary to COVID-19 was suspected due to physical exam findings of 
      conjunctivitis, mucositis, and shock. She improved following IVIG, aspirin, and 
      supportive care, and was discharged on hospital day 5. CONCLUSION: MIS-C-like 
      illness should be considered in adults presenting with atypical clinical findings 
      and concern for COVID-19. Further research is needed to support the role of IVIG and 
      aspirin in this patient population.

AB  - COVID-19 is causing a major once-in-a-century global pandemic. The scientific and 
      clinical community is in a race to define and develop effective preventions and 
      treatments. The major features of disease are described but clinical trials have 
      been hampered by competing interests, small scale, lack of defined patient cohorts 
      and defined readouts. What is needed now is head-to-head comparison of existing 
      drugs, testing of safety including in the background of predisposing chronic 
      diseases, and the development of new and targeted preventions and treatments. This 
      is most efficiently achieved using representative animal models of primary infection 
      including in the background of chronic disease with validation of findings in 
      primary human cells and tissues. We explore and discuss the diverse animal, cell and 
      tissue models that are being used and developed and collectively recapitulate many 
      critical aspects of disease manifestation in humans to develop and test new 
      preventions and treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe the successful pediatric liver transplant for unresectable 
      hepatoblastoma in a 4-year-old male with COVID-19 prior to transplant. The first 
      negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab was documented one month after initial diagnosis, 
      when SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were also detected. The patient was actively listed for 
      liver transplant after completing four blocks of a SIOPEL-4 based regimen due to his 
      PRETEXT IV disease which remained unresectable. Following three additional negative 
      NP swabs and resolution of symptoms for four weeks, he underwent a whole-organ 
      pediatric liver transplant. METHODS: COVID-19 positivity determined via NP swab 
      SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR (Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay). IgG and IgM 
      total SARS- CoV-2 antibodies detected by Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS® 
      Immunodiagnostics Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Test. RESULTS: Patient received standard 
      prednisone and tacrolimus-based immunosuppression without induction therapy 
      following transplant. Post-transplant course was remarkable for neutropenia and 
      thrombocytopenia, with discharge home on post-transplant day #11. Surveillance tests 
      have remained negative with persistent SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at six weeks after 
      transplant. CONCLUSIONS: We describe one of the earliest, if not the first case of 
      liver transplant following recent recovery from COVID-19 in a pediatric patient with 
      a lethal malignant liver tumor. A better understanding of how to balance the risk 
      profile of transplant in the setting of COVID-19 with disease progression if 
      transplant is not performed is needed. We followed existing ASTS guidelines to 
      document clearance of the viral infection and resolution of symptoms before 
      transplant. This case highlights that pediatric liver transplantation can be safely 
      performed upon clearance of COVID-19.

TI  - The Natural History of SARS-Cov-2 Related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in 
      Children (MIS-C): A Systematic Review.
LID - piaa112 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jpids/piaa112 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical manifestations and natural history of severe acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) related Multisystem 
      Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) are poorly defined. Using a systematic 
      review of individual cases and case series and collating elements of the clinical 
      course, the objective of this study was to provide a detailed clinical description 
      and natural history of MIS-C. METHODS: Case reports and series of MIS-C were 
      recovered from repeated MEDLINE searches, a single EMBASE search and table of 
      contents reviews of major general medicine and pediatric journals performed between 
      June 3 and July 23, 2020. Fever, evidence of inflammation, and evidence of organ 
      dysfunction were required for inclusion. RESULTS: MEDLINE and EMBASE searches 
      produced 129 articles and 10 articles were identified from journal contents or 
      article bibliographies; 16 reports describing 505 children with MIS-C comprise this 
      review. Thirty- two children (14.7%) had negative results for SARS-Cov-2 by nucleic 
      acid and/or antibody testing. The weighted median age was 9 years (6 months to 20 
      years). Clinical findings included fever (100%), gastrointestinal symptoms (88.0%), 
      rash (59.2%), conjunctivitis (50.0%), chelitis/ "strawberry tongue" (55.7%) or 
      extremity edema/erythema (47.5%). Median serum CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen and D dimer 
      concentrations were above the normal range. Intravenous gammaglobulin (78.1%) and 
      methylprednisolone/prednisone(57.6%) were the most common therapeutic interventions 
      ; immunomodulation was used in 24.3% of cases. Myocardial dysfunction requiring 
      ionotropic support (57.4%) plus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (5.3%), 
      respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation (26.1%), and acute kidney 
      injury (11.9%) were the major complications; anticoagulation was used commonly 
      (54.4%) but thrombotic events occurred rarely (3.5%). Seven (1.4%) children died. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C following SARS-Cov-2 infection frequently presents with 
      gastrointestinal complaints and/or rash; conjunctivitis, chelitis and/or extremity 
      changes also occur frequently. Serious complications occur frequently and respond to 
      aggressive supportive therapy.

TI  - GM-CSF blockade with mavrilimumab in severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic 
      hyperinflammation: a single-centre, prospective cohort study.
PG  - e465-e473
LID - 10.1016/S2665-9913(20)30170-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic 
      hyperinflammation is high. We aimed to examine whether mavrilimumab, an 
      anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor-α monoclonal 
      antibody, added to standard management, improves clinical outcomes in patients with 
      COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. METHODS: This single-centre 
      prospective cohort study included patients aged 18 years or older who were admitted 
      to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxia, and 
      systemic hyperinflammation. Patients received a single intravenous dose (6 mg/kg) of 
      mavrilimumab added to standard care given by the hospital at the time. The control 
      group consisted of contemporaneous patients with similar baseline characteristics 
      who received standard care at the same hospital. The main outcome was time to 
      clinical improvement (defined as improvement of two or more points on the 
      seven-point ordinal scale of clinical status). Other outcomes included proportion of 
      patients achieving clinical improvement, survival, mechanical ventilation-free 
      survival, and time to fever resolution. Adverse events were monitored daily. 
      FINDINGS: Between March 17 and April 15, 2020, 13 non-mechanically ventilated 
      patients (median age 57 years [IQR 52-58], 12 [92%] men) received mavrilimumab and 
      26 patients (median age 60 [IQR 53-67], 17 [65%] men) in the control group received 
      standard care. During the 28-day follow-up, no patients in the mavrilimumab group 
      died, and seven (27%) patients in the control group died (p=0·086). At day 28, all 
      patients in the mavrilimumab group and 17 (65%) patients in the control group showed 
      clinical improvement (p=0·030), with earlier improvement in the mavrilimumab than in 
      the control group (mean time to improvement 8 days [IQR 5 to 11] vs 19 days [11 to 
      >28], p=0·0001). By day 28, one (8%) patient in the mavrilimumab group progressed to 
      mechanical ventilation compared with nine (35%) patients in the control group who 
      progressed to mechanical ventilation or died (p=0·14). By day 14, fever resolved in 
      ten (91%) of 11 febrile patients in the mavrilimumab group, compared with 11 (61%) 
      of 18 febrile patients in the control group (p=0·18); fever resolution was faster in 
      mavrilimumab recipients versus controls (median time to resolution 1 day [IQR 1 to 
      2] vs 7 days [3 to >14], p=0·0093). Mavrilimumab was well tolerated, with no 
      infusion reactions. Three (12%) patients in the control group developed infectious 
      complications. INTERPRETATION: Mavrilimumab treatment was associated with improved 
      clinical outcomes compared with standard care in non-mechanically ventilated 
      patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. Treatment 
      was well tolerated. Confirmation of efficacy requires controlled testing. FUNDING:

AB  - We describe 2 patients with coronavirus disease who had multiple clinical features 
      suggestive of Kawasaki disease (KD). Both patients presented with fever lasting >5 
      days and were found to have rash, conjunctival injection, and swollen lips. One 
      patient also had extremity swelling, whereas the other developed desquamation of the 
      fingers. In both cases, laboratory results were similar to those seen in KD. These 
      patients had highly unusual but similar features, and both appeared to respond 
      favorably to treatment. It remains unclear whether these patients had true KD or 
      manifestations of coronavirus disease that resembled KD.

TI  - A Novel Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 500-504

AB  - In late March and early April, New York City was an epicenter of the COVID-19 
      pandemic. Citizens were ordered to stay at home to flatten the curve. The adult 
      population was affected with a severe respiratory illness as well as acute kidney 
      injury, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and thromboembolism. Although children were not 
      affected in the same manner, weeks after the peak, reports from other countries 
      emerged about cases of pediatric patients presenting with a novel inflammatory 
      syndrome. We present 4 patients along with their emergency department course, so 
      providers will have a better understanding of the identification and workup of these 
      patients. Currently, it is unclear when this inflammatory syndrome develops in 
      respect to a COVID-19 infection. The clinical features of this syndrome seem to 
      overlap between Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and myocarditis. All 
      patients presenting to our emergency department had fever, variable rash, abdominal 
      pain, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Patients remained persistently tachycardic and 
      febrile despite being given proper doses of antipyretics. Severity of presentations 
      varied among the 4 cases. All 4 patients were found to have antibodies to COVID-19. 
      All patients required admission, but 2 required the pediatric intensive care unit 
      for cardiac and/or respiratory support or closer monitoring. Upon follow-up on our 
      patients, it seems that most patients are recovering with treatment, and overall, 
      there is a low reported mortality rate.

AB  - ABO blood groups is a cheap and affordable test that can be immediately retrieved 
      from COVID-19 patients at the diagnosis. There is increasing evidence that non-O 
      blood groups have both higher susceptibility and higher severity of COVID-19 
      infections. The reason behind such relationship seems elusive. Regarding 
      susceptibility, Non-O individuals have Anti-A antibodies which can prevent viral 
      entry across ACE-2 receptors, moreover, Non-O individuals are at higher risk of 
      autoimmunity, hypercoagulable state, and dysbiosis resulting in an augmented 
      tendency for vascular inflammatory sequelae of COVID-19. We can conclude, on the 
      diagnostic level, that ABO blood groups can be potentially used for risk 
      stratification of affected COVID-19 patients, to anticipate the deterioration of 
      patients at higher risk for complications. On a therapeutic level, plasma from 
      normal O blood group individuals might potentially replace the use of convalescent 
      serum for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Cancer patients are a vulnerable population postulated to be at higher risk for 
      severe COVID-19 infection. Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer 
      patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, healthcare exposure, 
      and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have 
      focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the 
      generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 
      severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled 
      prior to the pandemic in a large academic biobank (n=67 cancer patients and n=256 
      non-cancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and 
      comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds 
      of hospitalization (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.12-4.18) and 30-day mortality (OR 5.67, CI 
      1.49-21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active 
      cancer. These results emphasize the critical importance of preventing SARS-CoV-2 
      exposure and mitigating infection in cancer patients.

AB  - Limited data are available for pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2. Serological 
      tests are critically important to determine exposure and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 
      within both individuals and populations. We completed SARS-CoV-2 serological testing 
      of 1,293 parturient women at two centers in Philadelphia from April 4 to June 3, 
      2020. We tested 834 pre-pandemic samples collected in 2019 and 15 samples from 
      COVID-19 recovered donors to validate our assay, which has a ~1% false positive 
      rate. We found 80/1,293 (6.2%) of parturient women possessed IgG and/or IgM 
      SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We found race/ethnicity differences in 
      seroprevalence rates, with higher rates in Black/non-Hispanic and Hispanic/Latino 
      women. Of the 72 seropositive women who also received nasopharyngeal polymerase 
      chain reaction testing during pregnancy, 46 (64%) were positive. Continued serologic 
      surveillance among pregnant women may inform perinatal clinical practices and can 
      potentially be used to estimate seroprevalence within the community.

      - Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in Indian Children.
LID - S097475591600220 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe the demographic, clinical and laboratory findings along with 
      the treatment and outcomes among children meeting the case definition of Pediatric 
      Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome - Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). 
      METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory findings of children who presented 
      with PIMS-TS during an 8-week period from May 4, 2020 to July 8, 2020. RESULTS: We 
      report 19 children with a median age of 6 year (IQR: 13 months - 16 years), who met 
      the case definition of PIMS-TS. All of them presented with fever. Multi organ 
      involvement (79%), mucocutaneous involvement (74%), cardiovascular symptoms (63%) 
      and gastrointestinal symptoms (42%) were the other features. Elevated levels of 
      C-reactive protein was found in all of them and the majority of them had evidence of 
      coagulopathy; intensive care admissions were needed in 12 (63%) and vasoactive 
      medications were given to 6 (31.5%) children. There were no deaths. CONCLUSION: 
      Children with PIMS-TS present with a wide range of signs and symptoms. Fewer 
      children in this series had coronary artery abnormalities, and there was a low 
      incidence of RT-PCR positivity with high presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

LID - 10.1016/j.jmii.2020.07.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the increasingly recognized impact of novel coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2), on many aspects of health in adults and children, its effects on 
      neonates born to infected mothers remain unclear. We conducted this study to 
      investigate the outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. METHODS: We 
      searched the medical databases from inception to March 31, 2020 to perform a 
      systematic review of outcomes in neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Data were 
      pooled using a random effects regression model. Primary and secondary outcomes were 
      neonatal clinical outcomes and infectious status, respectively. RESULTS: Fourteen 
      studies involving 105 neonates fulfilling the study criteria were identified. The 
      rates of preterm neonates and those small for gestational age (SGA) were 25 (23.8%) 
      and 10 (11.2%), respectively. Among 91 neonates who were tested, 8 (8.8%) were 
      positive for nucleic acids or antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 28 (26.7%) of 
      the neonates were symptomatic and two test-negative neonates died, including one 
      stillbirth. Between test-positive and test-negative groups, the rates of SGA, 
      preterm delivery, duration between maternal symptom onset and delivery, and 
      perinatal complication were not significantly different; but the rate of symptomatic 
      after birth reached significant difference (62.5% vs 20.5%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Most neonates born to infected mothers had favorable outcomes. Although direct 
      evidences of intrauterine infection were scarce, the risk of intrauterine infection 
      should be considered based on a positive test in 8.8% of the neonates. Symptomatic 
      neonates born to infected mothers should receive tests for SARS-CoV-2 to initiate 
      appropriate treatment and quarantine. Further studies are warranted to assess the 
      outcomes of COVID-19 in neonates.

AB  - A severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with Kawasaki disease 
      manifestations (MIS-C) has been recently reported in children with signs of recent 
      infection with SARS-CoV-2. We here reported the case of a young adult woman who 
      presented the complete manifestations of Kawasaki disease associated with a severe 
      myocarditis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and hemodynamic instability a few 
      weeks after a transient anosmia. The detection of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 
      in the absence of detection of the virus suggested that the syndrome was the result 
      of a delayed immune response to a recent COVID-19 infection. A combined treatment 
      with colchicine, tocilizumab, high dose immunoglobulins, and methylprednisolone 
      allowed to control the inflammatory process and to limit the development of coronary 
      aneurysm. The patient recovered without sequelae. This case emphasized the 
      importance of SARS-CoV-2 serology for the diagnosis of delayed immune complications 
      of COVID-19. Clinicians caring for adult patients must be aware that not only 
      children but also young adults can be affected by a multisystem inflammatory 
      syndrome with KD features associated with COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the screening and isolation measures for preventing coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection from newly admitted patients into a pediatric 
      oncology ward. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients with established 
      hematologic malignancies admitted for chemotherapy from January 23 to March 27, 2020 
      in the Department of Pediatric Hematology of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Every patient 
      and their caregivers were well educated on personal protection and put it into 
      effect at home and in hospital. Screening for COVID-19 of all the patients and 
      caregivers before admission was performed. Both clinical features and screening 
      results including chest computerized tomography (CT); nucleic acid testing of 
      nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or anal swabs; and quantitative antibodies (IgM and 
      IgG) detecting of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of 
      these patients were described. RESULTS: The results of nucleic acid and antibodies 
      (IgM and IgG) testing of all the 44 inpatients and their caregivers were negative. 
      Abnormal chest CT images were observed in six symptomatic patients, while chest CT 
      images of their caregivers did not show the changes related to viral pneumonia. 
      These symptomatic patients all recovered after antibacterial combined with 
      antifungal treatment, but without any antiviral agents. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 
      infection could be prevented in pediatric patients with malignancies if proper 
      protective measures were implemented. For patients presenting suspicious symptoms, 
      comprehensive examinations should be carried out.

AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD) is an important cause of childhood vasculitis and a common 
      cause of acquired heart disease in children world-wide. The emergence of Paediatric 
      Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome-Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2, a KD-like 
      hyperinflammatory syndrome and the recent death of Dr Tomisaku Kawasaki make this a 
      timely review. Although KD was described by Dr Kawasaki over 50 years ago, there is 
      still no specific diagnostic test and the aetiology remains elusive. This article 
      summarises the latest evidence, highlights important myths and misconceptions and 
      discusses some of the mysteries that surround this disease.

PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1007/s42399-020-00533-4 [doi]
AB  - Until either efficacious therapy or vaccination for COVID-19 is achieved, there will 
      be a need to regain world economic stability while yet controlling the pandemic with 
      current approaches. For those infected thus far, there is a prevailing perspective 
      that devising recognition for protective immunity will progressively allow segments 
      of society to return to some functionality more than is existing. At this time, the 
      best correlates with protection from natural coronavirus infections are systemic 
      neutralizing antibody and mucosal IgA. Serum neutralizing antibody more easily 
      fulfills the latter requisite, but current live virus methods for neutralization 
      prevent large-scale application. It is conceivable that the exposure of previously 
      infected individuals can allow for the definition of protective thresholds of 
      neutralizing antibody. Thereafter, many other antibody assays will be able to screen 
      for surrogate protection after correlations with protective neutralizing antibody 
      are made. Specificity of common antibody tests would benefit from confirmatory 
      blocking systems or confirmatory immunoblotting fingerprints with well-defined 
      antigen(s). The opportunity for the scientific community to make these assessments 
      is evident in the current context of the COVID-19 epidemic given the large numbers 
      of infected individuals worldwide. Such information will also be vital to guide 
      vaccine development and/or immunotherapy.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2 infection) is a new 
      challenge for all countries, and children are predisposed to acquire this disease. 
      Some studies have demonstrated more severe diseases in adults, but critically ill 
      pediatric patients have been described in all ages. Pulmonary involvement is the 
      major feature, and ventilatory support is common in critical cases. Nevertheless, 
      other very important therapeutic approaches must be considered. In this article, we 
      reviewed extensively all recent medical literature to point out the main clinical 
      attitudes to support these pediatric patients during their period in respiratory 
      support. Radiologic findings, fluid therapy, hemodynamic support, use of 
      inotropic/vasopressors, nutritional therapy, antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, 
      antithrombotic therapy, and immunoglobulins are analyzed to guide all professionals 
      during hospitalization. We emphasize the importance of a multi-professional approach 
      for adequate recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Two months after the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 
      Wuhan, China, tens of thousands of hospitalized patients had recovered, and little 
      is known about the follow-up of the recovered patients. METHODS: The clinical 
      characteristics, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results 
      from throat swab specimens and the results of serological COVID-19 rapid diagnostic 
      test (RDT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were 
      retrospectively reviewed for a total of 758 recovered patients who were previously 
      hospitalized in 17 hospitals and quarantined at 32 rehabilitation stations in Wuhan, 
      China. RESULTS: In total, 59 patients (7.78%) had recurrent positive findings for 
      COVID-19 on RT-PCR from throat swabs. With regard to antibody detection, 50/59 
      (84.75%) and 4/59 (6.78%) patients had positive IgG or dual positive IgG/IgM RDT 
      results, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who had been quarantined and had 
      subsequently recovered from COVID-19 had recurrent positive RT-PCR results for 
      SARS-CoV-2, and the possibility of transmission of the virus by recovered patients 
      needs further investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials

AB  - BACKGROUND: In China, mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia are 
      recommended to stop breastfeeding. However, the evidence to support this guidance is 
      lacking. There have been relatively few cases reported about direct breastfeeding an 
      infant by a mother with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Therefore, it is necessary to assess 
      the safety of breastfeeding and the possible protective effects of breast milk on 
      infants. CASE PRESENTATION: This report analyzes the case of a mother who continued 
      breastfeeding her 13 month-old child when both were diagnosed with confirmed 
      COVID-19 pneumonia. We describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and 
      outcome. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was determined in maternal serum, 
      breast milk, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and feces, and in infant serum, NP swabs and 
      feces. IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were assessed in maternal serum and 
      breast milk and in infant serum. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was not detected in the 
      breast milk, and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the mother's serum 
      and milk. CONCLUSIONS: The present case further confirms that the possibility of 
      mother-to-child transmission about SARS-CoV-2 via breast milk alone was very small, 
      and breast milk is safe for direct feeding of infants.

AB  - RATIONALE: Since the end of December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) epidemic has occurred and spread rapidly throughout China. At present, 
      China's epidemic situation has been basically controlled, but the number of cases 
      worldwide is increasing day by day. On March 11, the WHO officially announced that 
      the COVID-19 had become a global pandemic. However, there are currently limited data 
      on pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia and their infants. In this paper, a case 
      of a pregnant woman infected with COVID-19 pneumonia is reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: 
      We report a clinically confirmed COVID-19 pregnant woman. The patient was tested 
      negative 4 times in nucleic acid test, but immunoglobulin G was positive and 
      immunoglobulin M was negative before delivery, suggesting a previous infection. 
      DIAGNOSES: The pregnant woman underwent a computed tomography scan of both lungs at 
      29 + 2 weeks of pregnancy, and scattered stiffness and frosted glass shadows of both 
      lungs were observed. According to the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia in 
      the "New Coronavirus Prevention and Control Plan Fifth Edition" of the National 
      Health Commission of China, she was diagnosed as a clinically confirmed case. 
      INTERVENTIONS: The pregnant women received nebulized inhalation and oral 
      cephalosporin treatment in a community hospital and was discharged after the 
      symptoms disappeared. After that, she was isolated at home. OUTCOMES: The pregnant 
      woman gave birth to a healthy baby after being cured from COVID-19 infection. The 
      nucleic acid test of the neonatal pharyngeal swab was negative, and the neonatal 
      serum test showed positive for immunoglobulin G and negative for immunoglobulin M. 
      LESSONS SUBSECTIONS: The findings of this case report are useful for understanding 
      the possible clinical features of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women, the duration 
      of the antibody, and passive immunity of the fetus.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 infection status of hospitalized children was surveyed in the 
      department of pediatric hematology and oncology in three different hospitals of 
      epidemic areas in Hubei, China. A cross-sectional study was performed to investigate 
      the clinical characteristics, lung CT scan, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test and serum 
      antibodies of hospitalized children with hemato-oncological diseases from January 23 
      to April 24, 2020. 299 children were enrolled in this study, including 176 males 
      (58.9%) and 123 females (41.1%), aged from 2 months to 16 years. 255 cases (85.3%) 
      received chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapies, and there were 44 cases 
      (14.7%) of other benign diseases. Nucleic acid test was performed on 258 children 
      (86.3%) and one case was positive. 163 cases (54.5%) were tested for serum 
      antibodies, and all of them were negative. Lung CT scan was performed on 247 
      children (82.6%), and 107 of them showed infectious changes. Only one case (0.33%) 
      of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the group. The prevalence rate of COVID-19 in enrolled 
      children with hemato-oncological diseases in Hubei was 0.33%. Immunosuppressed 
      patients are not prone to produce related antibodies. Comprehensive protective 
      measures and ward management can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 
      group patients.

AB  - We report a case of an 8-year-old girl who underwent a SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      manifesting with atypical symptoms spearheaded by abdominal discomfort and systemic 
      inflammation and partially mimicking hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or 
      macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which however did not fulfill the HLH/MAS 
      diagnostic criteria. In this case of what has since been described as Pediatric 
      Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-COV-2 (PIMS-TS) we 
      documented excellent clinical response to immunosuppression with systemic 
      corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. We show a detailed longitudinal 
      development of neutrophil immunophenotype which suggests activation and engagement 
      of neutrophils during PIMS-TS with compensatory contraction of the response and 
      contra-regulation of neutrophil phenotype during recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytokine storm is a marker of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      illness severity and increased mortality. Immunomodulatory treatments have been 
      repurposed to improve mortality outcomes. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do immunomodulatory 
      therapies improve survival in patients with COVID-19 cytokine storm (CCS)? STUDY 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health 
      records across the Northwell Health system. COVID-19 patients hospitalized between 
      March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were included. CCS was defined by inflammatory 
      markers: ferritin, > 700 ng/mL; C-reactive protein (CRP), > 30 mg/dL; or lactate 
      dehydrogenase (LDH), > 300 U/L. Patients were subdivided into six groups: no 
      immunomodulatory treatment (standard of care) and five groups that received either 
      corticosteroids, anti-IL-6 antibody (tocilizumab), or anti-IL-1 therapy (anakinra) 
      alone or in combination with corticosteroids. The primary outcome was hospital 
      mortality. RESULTS: Five thousand seven hundred seventy-six patients met the 
      inclusion criteria. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (44%-59%), 
      diabetes (32%-46%), and cardiovascular disease (5%-14%). Patients most frequently 
      met criteria with high LDH (76.2%) alone or in combination, followed by ferritin 
      (63.2%) and CRP (8.4%). More than 80% of patients showed an elevated D-dimer. 
      Patients treated with corticosteroids and tocilizumab combination showed lower 
      mortality compared with patients receiving standard-of-care (SoC) treatment (hazard 
      ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55; P < .0001) and with patients treated with 
      corticosteroids alone (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.83; P = .004) or in combination with 
      anakinra (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81; P = .003). Corticosteroids when administered 
      alone (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.76; P < .0001) or in combination with tocilizumab 
      (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55; P < .0001) or anakinra (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.81; 
      P < .0001) improved hospital survival compared with SoC treatment. INTERPRETATION: 
      The combination of corticosteroids with tocilizumab showed superior survival outcome 
      when compared with SoC treatment and treatment with corticosteroids alone or in 
      combination with anakinra. Furthermore, corticosteroid use either alone or in 
      combination with tocilizumab or anakinra was associated with reduced hospital 
      mortality for patients with CCS compared with patients receiving SoC treatment.

TI  - Collaborative networks enable the rapid establishment of serological assays for 
      SARS-CoV-2 during nationwide lockdown in New Zealand.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serological assays that detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are critical for 
      determining past infection and investigating immune responses in the COVID-19 
      pandemic. We established ELISA-based immunoassays using locally produced antigens 
      when New Zealand went into a nationwide lockdown and the supply chain of diagnostic 
      reagents was a widely held domestic concern. The relationship between serum antibody 
      binding measured by ELISA and neutralising capacity was investigated using a 
      surrogate viral neutralisation test (sVNT). METHODS: A pre-pandemic sera panel (n = 
      113), including respiratory infections with symptom overlap with COVID-19, was used 
      to establish assay specificity. Sera from PCR‑confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n = 
      21), and PCR-negative patients with respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (n = 
      82) that presented to the two largest hospitals in Auckland during the lockdown 
      period were included. A two-step IgG ELISA based on the receptor binding domain 
      (RBD) and spike protein was adapted to determine seropositivity, and neutralising 
      antibodies that block the RBD/hACE‑2 interaction were quantified by sVNT. RESULTS: 
      The calculated cut-off (>0.2) in the two-step ELISA maximised specificity by 
      classifying all pre-pandemic samples as negative. Sera from all PCR-confirmed 
      COVID-19 patients were classified as seropositive by ELISA ≥7 days after symptom 
      onset. There was 100% concordance between the two-step ELISA and the sVNT with all 
      7+ day sera from PCR‑confirmed COVID-19 patients also classified as positive with 
      respect to neutralising antibodies. Of the symptomatic PCR-negative cohort, one 
      individual with notable travel history was classified as positive by two-step ELISA 
      and sVNT, demonstrating the value of serology in detecting prior infection. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These serological assays were established and assessed at a time when 
      human activity was severely restricted in New Zealand. This was achieved by generous 
      sharing of reagents and technical expertise by the international scientific 
      community, and highly collaborative efforts of scientists and clinicians across the 
      country. The assays have immediate utility in supporting clinical diagnostics, 
      understanding transmission in high-risk cohorts and underpinning longer‑term 'exit' 
      strategies based on effective vaccines and therapeutics.

AB  - RATIONALE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), now a global pandemic, has spread to 
      a large number of countries around the world. Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from 
      mild to severe, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. Some 
      cases even remain asymptomatic. Data regarding the epidemiological and clinical 
      features of children with COVID-19 are limited. Symptoms in children are thought to 
      be atypical when compared with adults. As a result, diagnosis in many children is 
      likely to be missed. Children presenting with atypical symptoms, especially those 
      with a history of exposure, should be referred to early screening. PATIENT CONCERNS: 
      A 23-month-old boy presented with a 2-day history of diarrhea. Chest computed 
      tomography scan showed pneumonia. After admission to the hospital, the patient 
      exhibited no diarrhea or other symptoms. Positive presence of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, was 
      confirmed by 5 consecutive rounds of nucleic acid amplification testing of 
      nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was also found to have liver damage. DIAGNOSIS: 
      Swabs were obtained for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by established methods. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Chinese traditional medicine prescription OUTCOMES:: Following 
      treatment, signs of pneumonia on computed tomography scans were observed to be 
      partially absorbed, and 2 consecutive rounds of nucleic acid amplification testing 
      of swab samples were negative. The patient was discharged on the 21st day after 
      admission to the hospital. On the 21st day after discharge, the patient had no 
      recurrence of disease, no recurrence of pulmonary lesions, and normal liver 
      function. CONCLUSION: This case study suggests that diarrhea not explained by common 
      causes, such as acute gastroenteritis, could be a preliminary symptom of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection in children. Despite the lack of the presence of a fever or cough, lung 
      pulmonary lesions were present in this child. SARS-CoV-2 infection may also cause 
      hepatic injury. Even during the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia recovery period, IgM and IgG 
      antibodies can be positive for a long time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 
      individuals with rare inborn errors of immunity (IEI), a population at risk of 
      developing severe COVID-19. This is relevant not only for these patients but also 
      the general population, as studies of IEIs can unveil key requirements for host 
      defense. OBJECTIVE: Describe the presentation, manifestations and outcome of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in IEI to inform physicians and enhance understanding of host 
      defense against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: An invitation to participate in a retrospective 
      study was distributed globally to scientific, medical and patient societies involved 
      in the care and advocacy for patients with IEI. RESULTS: We gathered information on 
      94 IEI patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Median age was 25-34 years. 53 patients 
      (56%) suffered from primary antibody deficiency, 9 (9.6%) had immune dysregulation 
      syndrome, 6 (6.4%) a phagocyte defect, 7 (7.4%) auto-inflammatory disorder, 14 (15%) 
      a combined immunodeficiency, 3 (3%) an innate immune defect, and 2 (2%) bone marrow 
      failure. Ten were asymptomatic, 25 were treated as outpatients, 28 required 
      admission without intensive care or ventilation, 13 required non-invasive 
      ventilation or oxygen administration, 18 were admitted to intensive care units, 12 
      requiring invasive ventilation, and 3 extra corporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine 
      patients (seven adults, two children) died. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates 
      that (1) >30% of IEI patients had mild COVID19, and (2) risk factors predisposing to 
      severe disease/mortality in the general population also seemed to affect IEI 
      patients, including more younger patients. Further studies will identify pathways 
      that are associated with increased risk of severe disease and are non-redundant or 
      redundant for protection against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a new virus that appeared in Wuhan, China, in 2019 has approximately an 
      80% genomic match to the Severe Acute Respiratory Symptom (SARS) virus, which is 
      known to come from a bat virus. Symptoms of Kawasaki disease in general and 
      incomplete Kawasaki disease have been seen in a subset of pediatric patients having 
      a current or previous infection of SARS-CoV-2. A viral infection, such as a 
      SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, could result in extensive antigen-antibody immune 
      complexes that cannot be quickly cleared in a subset of patients and thus create a 
      type III hypersensitivity immune reaction and cause Kawasaki disease or Kawasaki 
      disease symptoms (also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome) in a subset of 
      patients. Extensive binding of antibodies to viral antigens can create 
      antigen-antibody immune complexes, which, if not eliminated in certain individuals 
      having dysfunctional complement systems, can start inflammatory type III 
      hypersensitivity symptoms, including protease releases that can disrupt epithelium, 
      mesothelium, and endothelium basement membranes, and induce pervasive inflammation 
      throughout the body. This could continue after SARS-CoV-2 infections end if the 
      first wave of protease attacks on basement membranes created new secondary 
      autoantibodies and new uncleared antigen-antibody immune complexes.

AB  - During the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reports of a 
      new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been increasing in 
      Europe and the United States (1-3). Clinical features in children have varied but 
      predominantly include shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and elevated 
      inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and 
      interleukin-6 (1). Since June 2020, several case reports have described a similar 
      syndrome in adults; this review describes in detail nine patients reported to CDC, 
      seven from published case reports, and summarizes the findings in 11 patients 
      described in three case series in peer-reviewed journals (4-6). These 27 patients 
      had cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic symptoms without 
      severe respiratory illness and concurrently received positive test results for 
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or 
      antibody assays indicating recent infection. Reports of these patients highlight the 
      recognition of an illness referred to here as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in 
      adults (MIS-A), the heterogeneity of clinical signs and symptoms, and the role for 
      antibody testing in identifying similar cases among adults. Clinicians and health 
      departments should consider MIS-A in adults with compatible signs and symptoms. 
      These patients might not have positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test results, and 
      antibody testing might be needed to confirm previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because 
      of the temporal association between MIS-A and SARS-CoV-2 infections, interventions 
      that prevent COVID-19 might prevent MIS-A. Further research is needed to understand 
      the pathogenesis and long-term effects of this newly described condition.

TI  - Clinical spectrum and risk factors for complicated disease course in children

LID - 10.1016/j.anpede.2020.07.005 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: At this time there are still major questions about the characteristics 
      of disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in children as well as factors 
      associated with the development of severe forms of the disease. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Retrospective study including patients under 18 years of age admitted with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Infection was confirmed by 
      realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antibody 
      testing. We describe the epidemiological and clinical data, laboratory and imaging 
      findings, as well as treatment and outcome in these patients. In light of these 
      findings, patients were classified into two severity groups and then compared. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-nine children were included, with a median age of 9 years (range 12 
      days-16 years); 23 were boys. Cases with uncomplicated disease course (24) mostly 
      presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever and/or respiratory symptoms 
      without significant alterations in laboratory findings. Of the 15 children with a 
      complicated course, 12 developed shock. In addition to fever, they frequently 
      presented altered appearance, extreme tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, 
      diarrhea, rash, and/or conjunctival hyperemia. They also showed greater lymphopenia 
      (p = 0.001), elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.001), C-reactive protein 
      (p < 0.001), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), D-dimer (p < 0.001), and ferritin 
      (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in admitted children presents with 
      great clinical variability. When provided supportive care, patients with predominant 
      respiratory symptoms without altered laboratory-test results generally have an 
      uncomplicated course. Patients with complicated disease present mainly with fever 
      and abdominal and/or mucocutaneous symptoms. Most develop shock. Elevation of 
      inflammatory markers may allow for early detection and the final outcome is good.

AB  - A rise in cases with a new hyperinflammatory disease in children has been reported 
      in Europe and in the Unites States of America, named the Pediatric Inflammatory 
      Multisystem Syndrome-temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). There appears 
      to be a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms with varying degrees of severity, 
      including a toxic shock like presentation with hypovolaemia and shock, and a 
      Kawasaki-like presentation with involvement of the coronary arteries. Most of these 
      children have evidence of a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2, or a history of 
      significant exposure, but not all. Limited data exist on the incidence of PIMS-TS, 
      but it remains a rare condition. Early recognition and escalation of care is 
      important to prevent the development of serious sequelae, such as coronary artery 
      aneurysms. Clinicians assessing febrile children in primary and secondary care 
      should include PIMS-TS in their differential diagnoses. In children fulfilling the 
      case definition, additional investigations should be undertaken to look for evidence 
      of inflammation and multiorgan involvement. Suspected cases should be discussed with 
      experts in pediatric infectious diseases at an early stage, and advice should be 
      sought from critical care in more severe cases early. There is limited consensus on 
      treatment; but most children have been treated with immunoglobulins or steroids, and 
      with early consideration of biologicals such anti-TNF and anti-IL1 agents. Treatment 
      should ideally be within the context of controlled treatment trials. Clinicians are 
      encouraged to document and share their cases using research registries.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and exemplifies 
      the general threat to global health posed by coronaviruses. The urgent need for 
      effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high 
      resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus 
      vulnerabilities. To assist structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics 
      against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we developed CoV3D, a database and 
      molecular viewer of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus protein structures updated 
      weekly. CoV3D annotates structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with 
      antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Additionally, CoV3D provides information 
      on spike glycoprotein sequence variability and polymorphisms, and maps these 
      features onto the spike structure in the integrated molecular viewer. In order to 
      further aid structure-based design and analysis, CoV3D includes viewable and 
      downloadable spike glycoprotein structures with modeled glycosylation from Rosetta. 
      CoV3D is available at: https://cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, exemplifies the general threat to 
      global health posed by coronaviruses. The urgent need for effective vaccines and 
      therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of 
      SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. To 
      assist structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and 
      other coronaviruses, we have developed CoV3D, a database and resource for 
      coronavirus protein structures, which is updated on a weekly basis. CoV3D provides 
      users with comprehensive sets of structures of coronavirus proteins and their 
      complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Integrated molecular 
      viewers allow users to visualize structures of the spike glycoprotein, which is the 
      major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine design efforts, as well as sets 
      of spike-antibody complexes, spike sequence variability, and known polymorphisms. In 
      order to aid structure-based design and analysis of the spike glycoprotein, CoV3D 
      permits visualization and download of spike structures with modeled N-glycosylation 
      at known glycan sites, and contains structure-based classification of spike 
      conformations, generated by unsupervised clustering. CoV3D can serve the research 
      community as a centralized reference and resource for spike and other coronavirus 
      protein structures, and is available at: https://cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As of 30 April 2020, the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had infected 
      more than 3 172 000 individuals, killing over 224 000 people and spreading to more 
      than 200 countries. Italy was the most affected country in Europe and the third most 
      affected in the world in terms of the number of cases. Therefore, the aims of this 
      study are: (1) to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive 
      individuals among the general population of Verona; (2) to assess the accuracy 
      (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) of an ELISA serological test for 
      the screening of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will be carried out on 
      a random sample of subjects aged at least 10 years from the general population of 
      Verona. Participants will undergo the measurement of vital parameters (oxygen 
      saturation measured by oximeter, respiratory rate and body temperature detected by 
      laser thermometer), the administration of a COVID-19-related symptoms questionnaire, 
      the collection of a blood sample and a nasopharyngeal swab. Our evaluation will 
      include the statistical technique of Latent Class Analysis, which will be the basis 
      for the estimation of prevalence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has 
      been approved by the Ethics Committee of Verona and Rovigo provinces on 15 April 
      2020 (internal protocol number 2641CESC). The study results will be submitted for 
      publication in international, peer-reviewed journals and the complete dataset will 
      be deposited in a public repository. Most relevant data will be made available to 
      policy-makers as well as disseminated to stakeholders and to the community.

TI  - Kawasaki-like disease and acute myocarditis in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - reports of 
      three adolescents.
LID - 10.17305/bjbms.2020.5037 [doi]
AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may induce multisystem inflammatory 
      syndrome in children, which may be associated with Kawasaki-like disease, and 
      cardiac injury. In this study, we presented three male adolescents with multisystem 
      inflammatory syndrome and myocardial injury admitted to the hospital during the peak 
      of COVID-19 pandemic. All of the three patients had a history of fever, 
      gastrointestinal symptoms, polymorph rash, non-exudative conjunctivitis, and signs 
      of acute myocarditis. One of them had renal failure. Previously, they did not have 
      an acute infection. Upon admission, they were hypotensive and tachycardic. A 
      nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) assay was negative, but neutralizing viral antibodies were positive. 
      In combination with blood tests, ECG, echocardiography and computerized tomography 
      (CT), a multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with acute myocarditis with 
      mild to moderate systolic dysfunction and dilated coronary arteries were diagnosed. 
      Two of three patients had shock syndrome and required inotropic support. All 
      patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. The second patient had a 
      fever up to 102.2°F (39°C) three days after intravenous immunoglobulins. Further, he 
      was treated according to protocols for refractory Kawasaki disease, with an 
      intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy and aspirin. After a few hours, he 
      became afebrile and the clinical signs disappeared. The favorable short-term outcome 
      may reflect the early recognition and adequate therapy; however, the long-term 
      outcomes are currently unknown.

AB  - RATIONALE: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      pandemic, which quickly spread throughout the world, has been putting medical 
      workers all over the world in difficulty because of the high number of cases 
      combined with the lack of information about the disease. Although pediatric cases 
      are rare, the group age under 12 months has been in general more susceptible to 
      develop severe forms of the disease compared with the patients in the age interval 
      of 1 to 18 years. PATIENT CONCERNS: Three newborns have been tested positive for 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of them presented bilateral decreased air entry, while the 
      other 2 had no respiratory symptomatology. All 3 developed diaper erythema and oral 
      candidiasis. DIAGNOSIS: For building up the report, newborns that were positive for 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection were included in the case series. The 
      chest X-ray of the symptomatic patient revealed a medium degree of hilar parenchymal 
      infiltration and a slight infiltration of the visceral pleura. INTERVENTIONS: The 
      patients were admitted in our isolated neonatology ward. All of them received 
      antifungal treatment for the oral candidiasis and topic cream for diaper erythema. 
      The symptomatic patient also received prophylactic antibiotherapy, human 
      immunoglobulins, aminophylline, and parenteral nutrition. OUTCOMES: All 3 neonates 
      were discharged after 2 consecutive negative tests for SARS-CoV-2. Patients 1 and 2 
      fully recovered, whereas the condition of patient 3 improved. LESSONS: Even if there 
      are only a few reported cases of neonates infected with COVID-19 and most of them 
      present mild manifestations, newborns need a more careful insight because of the 
      nonspecific symptomatology.
